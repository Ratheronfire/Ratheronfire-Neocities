                <p>Completed the RetroAchievements set for this playthrough. Overall a really solid set, good balance of difficulty without relying on too many easily missable achievements or obnoxious requirements, as well as being a nice excuse to see some of the little touches you might miss otherwise. I did have to start up a second playthrough for the secret seashells achievement though, but that was mainly due to the game locking you out of two of them unless you obtain them at a really specific point.</p>
<p>Playing this game again after the Switch remake reminded me of how much I enjoyed it, as well as all the things I didn&rsquo;t care for about the remake: the soundtrack (while mostly good to great) had a few tracks that felt like major downgrades from the original, the dungeon builder feature was way less interesting than it should&rsquo;ve been, and most importantly they removed the photo album mechanic. I guess it makes sense considering the photos were only there for the Game Boy Camera, but it was really neat having all these little moments captured and highlighted.</p>
<p>I could play this game a hundred more times and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d get tired of it. For a Game Boy game, the level of detail and the amount of actual worldbuilding this thing has still blows me away, and reminds me why to this day I consider it my all-time favorite game.</p>
