      <description>Really didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to enjoy this as much as I did going in, but this game is just so much fun in a way that&amp;rsquo;s kinda hard to describe. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because I&amp;rsquo;m used to modern Sonic (or maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because of the mods that I was playing around with) but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have nearly as much trouble with the controls as a lot of other people did. Things like the pop-in and the occasional bug didn&amp;rsquo;t bother me too much, after the first few hours I didn&amp;rsquo;t really pay much attention to them anymore.</description>

      <description>Completed the RetroAchievements set for this playthrough. Overall a really solid set, good balance of difficulty without relying on too many easily missable achievements or obnoxious requirements, as well as being a nice excuse to see some of the little touches you might miss otherwise. I did have to start up a second playthrough for the secret seashells achievement though, but that was mainly due to the game locking you out of two of them unless you obtain them at a really specific point.</description>
