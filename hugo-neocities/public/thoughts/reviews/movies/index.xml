      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest, I&amp;rsquo;m not really a superhero guy. There&amp;rsquo;s stuff I like, but I tend to only check in on superhero stuff occasionally. Some of the DCAU shows, the Arkham games, that sort of thing. But when it comes to Marvel stuff, my experience is basically only the odd Spiderman thing here and there: I saw the Raimi movies which were outstanding for the most part, the first Amazing Spiderman which was fine I guess, and a bit of that Insomniac game (really need to get back to that, now that it&amp;rsquo;s finally on PC).</description>

      <description>Watched the 40th anniversary theater re-issue with a couple of friends. Still a fantastic movie and one of my all-time favorites, though every time I see it the dumber aspects are more apparent to me.

      <description>(Note: I wrote this up as a rough summary of my thoughts after watching the series for the first time leading up to the new movie. Copying them over here for posterity.)
Like with Reloaded, I had absolutely no idea where Revolutions was going to lead me going in. I knew we were going to see Agent Smith in the real world, I knew we were going to see the sentinels attack Zion, and I knew there was going to be something happening with Smith in the Matrix.</description>

Look, I&amp;rsquo;ve been on the internet for a while now. I know the Matrix sequels have a&amp;hellip; less than stellar reputation among fans. There are a lot of issues with these movies, and despite everything I&amp;rsquo;ve heard, I wanted to go in with an open mind.</description>

Even if you&amp;rsquo;ve never seen The Matrix, you&amp;rsquo;ve seen The Matrix. Very few movies are as iconic and embedded into our culture as this one, and even little things like Switch&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;not like this&amp;rdquo; scene still show up all the time in casual conversation.</description>
