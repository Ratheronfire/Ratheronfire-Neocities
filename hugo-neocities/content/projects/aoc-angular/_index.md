    The first iteration of Age of Clicking, written using Angular and TypeScript.  
    This started out as a learning exercise in Angular, but it quickly grew out of proportion and I ultimately couldn't figure out how to maintain stable framerates for the kind of game I wanted this to be.  
    I ended up halting development on this version and moving to Unity instead after just under a year or so on this project.
