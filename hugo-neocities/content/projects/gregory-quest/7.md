You reach out to drink **Macho Man's** **cream**. You realize that this thought is disgusting both literally and metaphorically, and decide against it.

**Macho Man** decides to speak first. "*I have a mission for you, little man. You already know part of what you have to do. You need to brave these woods and come out on the other side unscathed. Trust me, I'm better than you in every way.*"

It appears **Macho Man** will only tell you about your mission after you accept it.

[``> Decide to only drink the cream packet in my shirt pocket, then accept the mission and raise my hand for a fist-bump.``](../8)
