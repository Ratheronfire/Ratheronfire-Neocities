You down the **soup** as fast as you can and quickly fill up a mason jar with the rest. This probably wasn't the best idea, since the jar will heat up and become brittle from the drastic temperature change, but right now you're more concerned with outrunning **The Rock**.

You exit the cabin with the intent to run as far as you can, but instead you come face to face with **The Rock**. He looks a little ticked off at you entering his home uninvited.

**The Rock** is too big to run around. Looks like your only options are to fight him or reason with him.

[``> Tell the Rock that you could smell what he was cooking and that it smelled so good that I 	couldn't resist trying some and taking some for later.``](../13)
