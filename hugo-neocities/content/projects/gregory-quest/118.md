“*Hang on, you guys said you can see ‘through the veil’ and see everything, right? If you’ve been using this **meat-based divination** or whatever to see me, have you seen anything about **President Vince** or an ape called **Bubungo**?” The **druids** glance at one another for a moment before you hear their responses in your mind.

You consider the **druids'** offer, eventually deciding that you could use all the help you can get. "*Alright.*" you respond, "*Let's see this **meat ritual** of yours." You can immediately sense excitement from the **druids** in response.

The **pit druids** suddenly disperse around their **camp** to prepare for this '**meat ritual**' they're so keen to perform. You notice one begins digging around in a **wooden shed** nearby, eventually producing an impressive, highly ornamented **charcoal grill** made of **solid gold**. As he begins setting up the **grill**, a second **druid** then enters the **shed** and emerges a moment later carrying a **vintage VHS camcorder**, which he then mounts on a tripod pointing at the **golden grill**. A third **druid** then opens up an **ice chest** and pulls out an enormous **leg of mutton** and places it gingerly on an **empty picnic table** in front of the **grill**. The three then hurriedly run around the **camp**, gathering a variety of different **herbs and spices** and laying them out next to the **meat**.

With preparations complete, one of the **druids** stands behind the **picnic table** with the **leg of mutton**, and one of the others approaches the **camcorder**. He then holds up his fingers, counts down from 3, and presses **play**. You then hear the first **druid** begin talking, for the first time hearing his natural speaking voice instead of having his words beamed into your mind.

"*Hey all, welcome back to another episode of the **BBQ Pit Druids**! Today we've got something real special for y'all, we're gonna be preparing the **Sacred Mutton of Wrestlemania**! We got this beautiful **leg of mutton** right here and the **holy grill** is heating up, so let's get started.*" Hang on, is he filming a **cooking show**? You and your companions stand off to one side observing the druids prepare this '**Sacred Mutton**', narrating each step of the process to the camera in excruciating detail. **El Disgusto** appears starstruck, while you and the rest of your party simply observe in confusion as the smell of **barbecued lamb** makes you all ever hungrier.

Finally, after what feels like hours, the druids pull the cooked **leg of mutton** from the **holy grill** and place it on the **table**. "*Now that there is a fine **leg of lamb**!*" they continue to narrate, "*Now, all that's left is the **taste test**.*" The **druid** behind the **camera** gestures for you to step forward, and you reluctantly join the rest of the **druids** at the **table**. "***BBQ Pit legends** say that only the **Chosen One of Wrestlemania** can consume the **Sacred Mutton**, and it just so happens that we have **the chosen one** right here! Go ahead **Gregory**, dig in.*"

Never one to turn down a free meal, you lift the **roasted mutton** up to your mouth and take a quick taste test. The moment the **meat** hits your lips your entire body and mind feel as if you've ascended to **Nirvana**. This meal the **BBQ Pit Druids** have prepared is the very definition of divine, the meat is impossibly tender and juicy, and perfectly seasoned just the way you like it. Unable to control yourself you begin digging voraciously into the **leg of mutton**, and as you eat you lose all sense of the passage of time and your eyes roll back into your head from **pure ecstasy**. Soon enough you've single-handedly reduced the entire **leg of mutton** to **bones**, and with nothing else left to eat you suddenly feel yourself fall backwards into the grass and pass out.

You sleep blissfully for several hours, and in your dreams you see visions of **roasted meats** dancing before you. Eventually the **illusory meats** appear to coalesce into an abstract scene of vaguely humanoid figures fighting. On one side is a group of six very burly humanoid figures being led by one much shorter and skinnier figure, and opposing them is a single muscular humanoid side-by-side with a bulkier, more **ape-like** figure. Towering above this scene is a giant **meat-visage** of what looks like **Vince McMahon**, with long **sausage links** extending down from his fingers to both groups of fighters like **puppet strings**. 

When you finally awaken from your **mutton-induced stupor**, you sit up from the grass and notice it's now the early evening. Looking around, you spot your crew sitting at one of the **picnic tables** with the **Pit Druids**, chatting idly while eating **racks of ribs**.

What will you do?
