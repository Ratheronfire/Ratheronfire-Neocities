You run towards the cabin and enter. The smell of food hits your nostrils almost instantly. There's a large cast iron pot hanging above the fireplace emanating a delicious aroma of meat stew. The cabin's furniture is old and comprised almost entirely of oak and cast iron. The cabin even has some taxidermied game heads on the walls, and is lit with oil lanterns. What a cozy place!

You grab a bowl from the cupboard and go to grab yourself some **stew**, when suddenly you hear another shout in the distanceâ€¦

"*CAN YOU SMELL WHAT THE ROCK IS COOKING?*"

A chill shoots down your spine. **Macho Man** wasn't warning you about simple stones. This is a dangerous place to be.

You are in the cozy cabin. **The Rock** is coming for you. Will you try to run, or try to find a weapon?

[``> Might as well eat the soup, maybe see if there are any bottles around to keep some for later. Then run for my life.``](../12)
