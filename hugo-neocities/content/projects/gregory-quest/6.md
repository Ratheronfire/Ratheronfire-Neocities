You enter the bog. You, for some inexplicable reason, decide to wade through the disgusting, bubbling swamp water to get to your destination.

Eventually you arrive at a pond with a capsized boat. You go to step into the water before you hear a ghostly voice.

"*Hello, Gregory.*"

You spin around on your heel, full of adrenaline and ready to fight, but what you see shocks you.

"*I know you're unjustifiably in a position you'd rather not be inâ€¦*"

The ghost of **Macho Man Randy Savage** has appeared in front of you!

"*...but the cream will rise to the top,*" finished the ghostly wrestler as he pulls a non-ghostly packet of **cream** from seemingly nowhere. "*That's right, **Gregory**, you're the cream of the crop,*" said **Macho Man** as he places another **cream packet** into your shirt pocket, "*That's why you're here. No man is better than **Macho Man Randy Savage**, but I got creamed in my last fight.*" **Macho Man** balances yet another **packet of cream** on his head. Where does he keep getting these?

You have so many questions. What will you ask the ghostly sage first?
