"*Hey, do you want these? They're chocolate,*" you say as you hold the **coins** out to the **barkeep**. He shrugs, shakes his head in confusion, and tells you that you can keep them. You eat the **coins**, realizing you haven't eaten since before your encounter with **Bubungo**. You feel a little more energized, but still weary. 

The bar is now devoid of life, save for you and the **barkeep**. **Mike** and **Jimmy** left long ago, but not before saying goodbye. Everyone's gone, and you've cleaned up nicely. "*Alright, you've done enough for sure,*" says the **barkeep**. "*Go get some sleep, you look like you need it. Your **room's** upstairs on the right. Door's unlocked. I'm gonna get some shuteye.*" The **barkeep** lets out a yawn before heading upstairs and walking into the unlit hallway.

Do you go to sleep, or search the bar for **clues**? Perhaps you want to steal from the **register**? Maybe explore the **dead town**? The choice is yours!

[``> Wander the streets for a few minutes before bed to familiarize myself with the town.``](../66)
