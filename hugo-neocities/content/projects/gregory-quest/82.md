Certain that you never want to see another **ice cream cone** for the rest of your life, you exit the **ice cream parlor**. While your questionable decisions at **Stone-Cold Creamery** did at least curb your hunger for the time being, you decide you should stock up on some provisions before you leave town and head for the greengrocer.

As you cross the plaza you briefly glance down at your wrist to determine how much time you have left before you need to return to the **mine**, but quickly remember that you no longer have a watch. While you don't the time for certain, based on the height of the sun in the sky and a guess at how long you spent at each store, you assume about an hour has passed since you left the mine office. "*I probably shouldn't spend too much time here, don't want to leave **Johnny** waiting.*" you think to yourself before entering the shop.

Compared to everything else you've seen in **Wrestlemania**, **The People's Harvest** is probably the most normal looking business you've encountered so far. There are a few aisles stocked with a variety of **fresh fruits** and **vegetables**, and you see a handful of **tribesmen** walking around the shop with **bags of produce**. The **produce** itself also seems fairly standard, though you do spot some **fruits** and **vegetables** with unfamiliar names in the mix. There is also, unsurprisingly, an entire aisle dedicated to various flavors and brands of **whey** and other **protein supplements**.

Will you shop for some **groceries**, or change your mind and head for the **apothecary** now?

[``> Grab some light supplies and a healthy dosage of protein supplements, then head over to the apothecary.``](../83)
