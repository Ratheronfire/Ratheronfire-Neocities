One of the **druids** notices you sitting up, and you once again begin hearing their voices in your mind.

{{< rawhtml >}}<p style="text-align: center">{{</ rawhtml >}}
“{{< ethereal 0 >}}The chosen one stirs{{</ ethereal >}}”
{{< rawhtml >}}</p>{{</ rawhtml >}}

{{< rawhtml >}}<p style="text-align: center">{{</ rawhtml >}}
“{{< ethereal 1 >}}The ritual has succeeded{{</ ethereal >}}”
{{< rawhtml >}}</p>{{</ rawhtml >}}

{{< rawhtml >}}<p style="text-align: center">{{</ rawhtml >}}
“{{< ethereal 2 >}}Are you content with your decision to partake in the sacred meat?{{</ ethereal >}}”
{{< rawhtml >}}</p>{{</ rawhtml >}}

You stand up and rub the sleep out of your eyes, and are now realizing you feel far stronger and more energized than you ever have before. Evidently the **druids** weren't kidding, you definitely feel like you have the power to fight your enemies now. "*Absolutely!*" you respond, "*I feel amazing, and that was probably the best meal I've ever had! Plus, I think the ritual gave me a **vision** while I was knocked out too.*" **The BBQ Pit Druids** stand up from the bench and approach you, and your companions do the same shortly after.

"*Another **vision**? What more did you see, was it anything like our **ritual** back at my place?*" **The Undertaker** asks as he approaches you. "*Not really, this was more abstract than the **scrying ritual**. I saw figures that I think were supposed to represent all of us, including the guys we haven't rescued yet, and it looked like we were fighting **John** and **Bubungo**. **Vince** was there too, but he was looming over all of us and controlling both sides like **puppets**.*" You look around at the group that's gathered around you, and both the members of your party and the **BBQ Pit Druids** appear deeply disturbed by your vision.

{{< rawhtml >}}<p style="text-align: center">{{</ rawhtml >}}
“{{< ethereal 0 >}}Visions brought upon by the sacred meats can have many meanings, do not allow what you saw to alter your course{{</ ethereal >}}”
{{< rawhtml >}}</p>{{</ rawhtml >}}

{{< rawhtml >}}<p style="text-align: center">{{</ rawhtml >}}
“{{< ethereal 1 >}}You should now be prepared to finish your journey{{</ ethereal >}}”
{{< rawhtml >}}</p>{{</ rawhtml >}}

{{< rawhtml >}}<p style="text-align: center">{{</ rawhtml >}}
“{{< ethereal 2 >}}But before you depart, we have one final gift to bestow upon you should you choose to accept it{{</ ethereal >}}”
{{< rawhtml >}}</p>{{</ rawhtml >}}

Another **gift**? You consider what more these strange **druids** could possibly have for you. Obviously anything that could help you take down **Bubungo** would be of great help, but you're also wary of the powers the **BBQ Pit Druids** harness.

Will you accept their final gift?
