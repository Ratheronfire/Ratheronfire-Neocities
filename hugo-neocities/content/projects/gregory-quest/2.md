You tell **John** to answer the phone. Although mildly irritated, **John** agrees and answers your phone for you. He exchanges a few choice words with his impromptu conversational partner and hangs up. You ask, "*Who was it?*" "*That was your mother calling,*" says **John**. You both doubt and fear his response.

You don't think **John** wants to talk today. You should probably give whoever that was a call back and apologize. Or don't. I'm not a cop.

What do you do?
