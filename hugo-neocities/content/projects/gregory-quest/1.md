You are **Gregory**, a completely normal and incredibly boring individual. You live with your only marginally more interesting roommate, **John**: a self-proclaimed meme expert. You work at a supermarket as a part-time manager. John has no job.

You wake up on a beautiful saturday morning in your shared apartment. John is watching TV. You hear your phone ringing. You suspect that you don't want to talk to whoever's calling. What do you do?

[``> Tell John to answer the phone instead.``](../2)
