"***The Undertaker** sent me in this direction to look for **reagents**. He said I'd find them in a town named **Loincloth**, but he never said anything about this place.*"

"*Well, if you want **reagents**, you can probably find 'em here. I've heard of **Loincloth**, but I don't really know where it is, sorry. Our **resident geomancer** might know, though. He's the mayor, you know. Really cool guy, knows a lot of stuff. I think his office is closed 'til the morning, though.*" 

Sounds like you have some time to kill. Do you want to stay in the bar to talk to the locals more, or explore the town?
