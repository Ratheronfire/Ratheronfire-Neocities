Concentrating with all your might, you somehow manage to conjure your **laptop**. To your amazement, you're also able to access the internet from wherever it is the **tunnel drink** spat you out! "*I should really remember to use these abilities I've suddenly realized I have in future encounters,*" you think to yourself. Unfortunately your memory isn't what it used to be.

You connect to **GameFAQs** and look up "***Gregory Quest**.*" You find exactly one guide, last updated March 15, 2004 by **SoraXRikuFan774**. It's 50,000 words long and has a sick ASCII logo at the top. You're in luck!

Oddly enough, the section covering this chapter also describes looking up a guide on **GameFAQs**, and describes the character of **Gregory** finding a guide whose descriptions exactly match the one you're reading. In fact, the entire rest of the guide is nothing but a recursive loop of **Gregorys** looking up guides telling them what to do in **Gregory Quest**, only to find out that the guide writer also had to look up a guide.

You close the guide as your migraine begins to swell. "*Maybe the message boards have some tips for me,*" you think. No such luck there, though, as the entire board has been overtaken by people who have decided to make it the unofficial board for their favorite obscure mid-2000s internet cartoon, **Bonus Stage**.

Your laptop's battery dies. Apparently you forgot to charge it last night, as usual. Probably should've made better use of it while it still had charge.
