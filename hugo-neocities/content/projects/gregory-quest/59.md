You watch **the show** for a couple minutes. It's been so long since you've watched any **TV**â€¦

The **show** gets to a part where a guy is trying to go up some stairs, but he keeps showing up at the bottom. There's another guy at the top laughing a lot. What kind of idiot can't get up stairs? Weird. You notice a couple bar patrons watching the show and striking poses. Huh, okay.

You think you've had enough of this for now. What will you do next?
