You tie the **rope** around your **pelvis** like some sort of **rope diaper**. Amazing! This looks very normal. You continue heading west and try to find a beach without any observers. Eventually, you find a nice, secluded area, and pull yourself ashore. You pull the **boat** up on the sand so it can't float away.

You are facing north on the beach. To the northeast is a **short hill** with a dirt path, possibly leading to **civilization**. To the west is a **dark, brambled part of the mangroves** with a single visible path. To the south are **more mangroves** as far as the eye can see.

Which way will you go?
