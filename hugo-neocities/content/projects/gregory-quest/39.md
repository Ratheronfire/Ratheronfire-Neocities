While you're crouching next to the doorway, about to run into combat, you turn to face **Mankind**. "*Hey, do you know something you aren't telling me?*"

"*Like what?*"

"*What happened to **Vince** after he got pissed off?*"

"*Oh, he just got mad that his head was shaved. He was embarrassed as all getout. He started acting like an ass after that, he got mad a lot, all sorts of stuff. Not sure if he ever recovered before he died,*" says **Mankind**, while caressing his **shotgun**, anxious for combat. "*Are we gonna go **kick some ass**, or what?*"

Will you go **kick some ass**, or what?
