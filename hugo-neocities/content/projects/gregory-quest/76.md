You lean over and rest your crossed arms on the desk. “*Are you busy in the mean time?*” you ask, with a **slight smile** on your face. The **receptionist** flashes you a bright smile. “*Yes,*” she says cheerfully, “*I’m busy from now until the end of time.*” Your **slight smile** morphs into a **slight frown** as you move your arms from the table. Well then! You tried. Good job.

You have an hour or two before **Johnny**, whoever that is, comes back. What will you do?
