"*Sorry, mister **Rock**, sir, I was starving! I've been walking for hours, and that **stew** smelled so good that I couldn't help myse-*"

**The Rock** belts out a long, hearty laugh. "*Don't worry about it, I have plenty to share! It's been so long since I've seen another face... Please, sit down.*"

You and **The Rock** sit down by the fireplace. "*What brings you to my cabin?*" You see no reason to lie, and say "*This may sound ridiculous, but I'm on a mission from **Macho Man Randy Savage**. I have to stop **John Cena** before he-*"

"*Say no more. **Cena** has been the enemy of **my tribe** for many years. We have normally been able to fight back, but **Cena** has become too powerful. Other than myself, there are only a few tribesmen left. I will help you on your mission.*"

{{< align "center" >}}Well, this was certainly unexpected. ***The Rock** has joined your party!*{{</ align >}}

Will you set out on your journey, or rest a while first?

[``> Finish eating the soup with the Rock, then ask him if the other members of his tribe are around and could be of any help.``](../14)
