You think for a moment before finally deciding to accept. "*Alright, I'll accept your **gift**.*" Content with your answer, one of the **druids** walks back over to their shed. They exit a moment later, now carrying a small, highly decorated **wooden chest**. The **druids** hold the **chest** before you and your party, carefully undo the lock, and slowly open the **chest*. You hear your companions gasp as the **Pit Druids** reveal...

...a ratty old pair of **leather boots**. Lovely. While you have absolutely no desire to take a gross pair of old shoes with you, **El Disgusto** speaks up in excitement before you can say anything. "*Dios mio **Gregory**, this is incredible! Those are the {{< rawhtml >}}<em style="color: gold">Holy Barbecue Shoes</em>{{</ rawhtml >}}, a sacred **Wrestlympian relic**! **The BBQ Pit Druids** have never allowed outsiders to even see the **relic**, this is truly an honor!*" Uh... alright then. You reluctantly take the **grody boots**; they feel about 10 sizes too big for you and you're easily able to slip them on over your current shoes. Much to your surprise, the '{{< rawhtml >}}<em style="color: gold">barbecue shoes</em>{{</ rawhtml >}} ' are actually fairly comfortable, and they seem to imbue you with an even greater feeling of strength. "*Well, thank you guys for everything. I think we should probably continue on our way now.*" you say to the **druids** as you adjust to your new footwear.

“{{< ethereal 0 >}}Of course{{</ ethereal >}}”
{{< rawhtml >}}</p>{{</ rawhtml >}}

{{< rawhtml >}}<p style="text-align: center">{{</ rawhtml >}}
“{{< ethereal 1 >}}Anything for Wrestlemania's chosen{{</ ethereal >}}”

{{< rawhtml >}}<p style="text-align: center">{{</ rawhtml >}}
“{{< ethereal 2 >}}Before you leave, if you'd like anything else to remember your time with us we have much more to share... for a price{{</ ethereal >}}”
{{< rawhtml >}}</p>{{</ rawhtml >}}

Suddenly one of the **druids** opens up his **robe**, revealing a series of **BBQ Pit Druids**-branded **tee shirts**, **hoodies** and **hats** hanging from one side of the **robe**, and similarly-branded **spatulas**, **cooking knives** and **bottled spice mixes** on the other. You stare at the collection of souvenirs for a moment before simply replying with "*I'm good.*" "*As you wish.*" the **druid** responds as he wraps up his robe again.

"*Thank you all for your hospitality. This was truly an honor.*" **The Rock** says as you and your party prepare to leave. “*Yes, and thanks for the grub too.*” **The Undertaker** adds as you see him sneak a **rack of ribs** into his coat pocket. **El Disgusto** then quickly runs up to each **druid** to give them a vigorous handshake, clearly still starstruck by his **meaty heroes**. "*Of course, good luck to you all.*" one of the **druids** responds. With that, you begin leading your group back through the woods. You trek for another several minutes as the sun steadily sets, and as you walk the hypnotic music and smells gradually fade away. You finally emerge back on the main road to **Hollow Hold** just as the twilight fades. "*Alright, everybody ready to find **Macho Man**?*" you ask as you look back to the group, but as you look around your party you notice **El Disgusto** is no longer with you. "***El Disgusto**, you there?*" you call out in the direction of the woods.

After a moment you hear **El Disgusto** shout back "*Sorry! Just a minute!*" and a few moments later he emerges from the woods as well. You notice he's now wearing a **black tee shirt** over his **leotard**, bearing red text reading "*I Met the **BBQ Pit Druids**, and all I got was **This Lousy Shirt***". You and the rest of the group collectively groan at the sight of his new attire.

You're currently on the road just north of **Hollow Hold**. You've been granted immense power by the **BBQ Pit Druids' sacred meat ritual** and the {{< rawhtml >}}<em style="color: gold">Holy Barbecue Shoes</em>{{</ rawhtml >}}, and are currently carrying a **multitool**, some **gauze** and a **healing poultice**, along with the **partial bottle of tunnel drink** and pouch of **2340 coins** that I forgot about before. Will you finally continue onwards to **Hollow Hold**, or change your mind at the last second for no reason?
