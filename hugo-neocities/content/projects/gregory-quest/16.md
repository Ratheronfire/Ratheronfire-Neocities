"***Macho Man**, what's it like being dead?*"

"*It sucks, man. I still have to walk everywhere. No flying or moving through walls either. You know what I did yesterday? I stubbed my toe on a rock. Twice. I'm dead and I can still stub my toes. If I knew being dead was going to be this bad, I never would've died in the first place.*"

You decide not to ask **Macho Man** what he means by that and instead ask **The Rock** for his **soup recipe**. "*It's a bunch of old plants and dead animals from the forest. It's a perpetual stew. I'm a little shocked your stomach could take it.*"

Several hours have passed and you're only halfway to the tribal camp. You have a few more questions on your mind.

[``> Quietly toss the jar of soup I saved earlier aside, then ask the Rock what his title means among the people in his society, and ask Macho Man if there's anything more he can tell me about the mission or where we're going.``](../17)
