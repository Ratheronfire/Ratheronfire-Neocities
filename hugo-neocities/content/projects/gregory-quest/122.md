Much to your **stinky friend’s** disappointment, you ignore the suggestion to set up camp for the moment and approach the **doors**. You give the large wooden **doors** a few good, hard knocks, then take a step back. You wait a few moments without a response before approaching the **door** to knock again, this time calling out “*Hello, anyone home?*” as you knock. You wait another few moments, but still receive no response. “*See, looks like everyone’s asleep! Like we should be…*” **El Disgusto** grumbles.

Well, looks like you won’t be getting in through the front door right now. Will you give in to **El Disgusto’s** whining and wait until morning, try to find another way into **Hollow Hold**, or ignore your better judgment and keep knocking until your knuckles bleed?
