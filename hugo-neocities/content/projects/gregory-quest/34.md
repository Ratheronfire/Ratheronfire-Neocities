You walk out of the cage, over to the nearest wall, and grab a torch. You turn to face **Mankind**, who continues to stare in the same direction. "*Will you come with me?*"

**Mankind** turns to face you. "*Yeah.*" He smiles, and walks over to you.

{{< align "center" >}}***Mankind** has joined your party!*{{</ align >}}

"*Where to?*"

Will you explore the barren stadium, leave the stadium, or try to access the basement?

[``> Try to find some of my stuff or my other friends in the stadium.``](../35)
