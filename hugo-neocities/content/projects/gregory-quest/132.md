With the **disguises** settled and your affairs in **Hollow Hold** in order, you decide now is a good time to head on to meet **The Rock tribe** again. “*Alright, everybody ready?*” You ask your **allies**, and are quickly met with a unanimous and slightly frustrated “*YES!*” from all four of them simultaneously.

You begin leading your gang across the courtyard, but before you even make it more than a couple yards you suddenly trip and land flat on your face. “*You alright, **Gregory**?*” **Macho Man** asks as you pick yourself up off the ground. “*I think so…*” you reply as you look down to your feet, suddenly realizing that the laces on one of your {{< rawhtml >}}<em style="color: gold">BBQ shoes</em>{{</ rawhtml >}} had gone undone. “*Just give me a sec, guess I need to re-tie my {{< rawhtml >}}<em style="color: gold">boots</em>{{</ rawhtml >}}.*”

You take a moment to securely tie up the **loose lace** on your {{< rawhtml >}}<em style="color: gold">BBQ shoe</em>{{</ rawhtml >}}, then redo the **lace** on the {{< rawhtml >}}<em style="color: gold">opposite shoe</em>{{</ rawhtml >}} to make sure it’s also good and tight. Finally, satisfied your {{< rawhtml >}}<em style="color: gold">boots</em>{{</ rawhtml >}} won’t come undone again, you stand up and brush yourself off.

Ok **bozo**, we gonna go now or are you gonna waste even more time?
