"*Isn't this guy supposed to be dead? And why is he insane now?*"

**Macho Man** responds. "*He's a being of unimaginable power, **Gregory**. He's not dead because he was never alive. He's always been this crazy. The dude was a legend in **Wrestlympus** until we kicked him out for stealing copper pipes from the bathrooms. I don't know how he ended up hereâ€¦*"

"*Well, **Mr. Warrior**, why should we trust you? Before we let you out, prove your loy-*" "*SHADDUP BUD!*" **The Ultimate Warrior** breaks through the cell door with ease and steps into the hallway. "*I GOT YEARRRRS OF EXPERIENCY BUDDY! I KNOW HOW TO BLAST **CENA** STRAIGHT OUTTA **WRESTLYMPUS**! I HAVE A **SACRED OBJECT** THAT WILL EJECT HIM FROM THIS LAND...*" **The Ultimate Warrior** pulls out a **small wooden box** from thin air. "*IT'S FORBIDDEN TO SPEAK OF! I COULD GET ARRESTED! **THE GODS** DON'T LIKE THIS STUFF PAL!*" You don't understand, and you're not sure you have to.

"*I CAN TELEPORT US STRAIGHT TO **WRESTLYMPUS** RIGHT NOW **GREGGY**. JUST SAY THE WORD OL' BUDDY AND WE'LL GO BUST HIM UP RIGHT NOW. LET'S DO IT MATEYS!*"

What an unstable individual. Well, he did say to just give him the word...
