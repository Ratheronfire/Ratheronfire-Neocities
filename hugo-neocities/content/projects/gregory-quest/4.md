You set the mail on fire without reading it. Looks like some charities sent you a few too many nickels, the flame is burning with a bluish-green tint! This impromptu bonfire seems to have made **John** come outside. What a great time to tell him about his eviction!

**John** doesn't take the news very well. He begins to shout, and it seems like he's going to get violent soon. You pull out your phone to call the police, but you notice that your phone is missing! You look up to **John** only to realize that **John** is missing too! 

You hear a shout of "*Can't see me*" that is simultaneously distant and surrounding. Now you remember **John's** last name: ***Cena***. You turn around to run back to your apartment's landline, but your apartment building is gone. In fact, your entire city block is missing! It looks like you've been transported to a forest clearing. Better go sort this mess outâ€¦

You are in the middle of a dense forest. Trees surround you in all directions. Though the sun is high in the sky, the forest seems to be shrouded in darkness.

What will you do?
