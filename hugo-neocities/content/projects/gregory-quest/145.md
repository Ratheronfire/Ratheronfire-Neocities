You and your allies sit in awkward silence for a few minutes while you think about all the evidence you were able to present. The silence is deafening, and you can't help but worry that the material you were able to come up with wasn't enough. Eventually you look to your companions, hoping for some reassurance.

"*Hey guys, do you think the evidence we were able to give them was enough? We did talk for a while, but a lot of what we had was mostly circumstantial. It also seemed like they were putting extra focus on my testimony, but all the evidence I had came from visions and dreams. Should I have tried to think of something more tangible than that?*"

**The Rock** looks to you with an uneasy smile. "*I appreciate your concern, **Gregory**, but do not fear. We provided the **tribe** with all the evidence we had, if that is not enough then so be it. Also, do not worry about your evidence only coming from visions. My **tribe** is very spiritually-minded, they should all recognize the importance of your testimony.*" You feel slightly relieved by **The Rock's** reassurance, and silence washes over the room once again.

You and your allies remain seated in the **dining hall** for what feels like hours; while **El Disgusto** falls asleep almost immediately, you and the majority of your team simply sit and fidget nervously while **The Rock** spends the time meditating. Finally, just as you begin to notice the room getting dimmer as the sun begins to set, you hear the doors to the room rattle and swing open. **The Rock tribe's elder** enters once again, though now the rest of the **tribe** is nowhere to be found. Instead, the **elder** is accompanied only by five other **The Rocks** whose garb seems to indicate they also occupy positions of power within the **tribe**, along with three **guards** armed with **spears**. This group of nine **The Rocks** approaches your table, and your **The Rock** stands to meet them.

"*The **tribe** has come to a conclusion. Do you have any last words before we deliver the ruling?*”
