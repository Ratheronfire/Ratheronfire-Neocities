Free to explore the **compound**, you figure now would be an excellent time to browse the **tribe’s marketplace**. You turn to **The Rock**, figuring he can show you to the closest shop. “*Hey **The Rock**, how about we hit the **market** first? You must still remember where the closest **store** is, right?*”

**The Rock** looks at you with a befuddled look on his face. “***Gregory**… this is a **fortified refugee camp**. Travelers are not generally welcome within the walls unless it is for official business. There is a **blacksmith** and an **armorer** to supply the **village watch**, but you’ll find no formal marketplace here.*” Once **The Rock** finishes speaking, **Macho Man** butts in with his own comment. “*Also it’s like 8pm, so I dunno what kinda shops you were expecting to find open at this hour even if there were any.*”

Welp, so much for that idea. Got any other bright suggestions?
