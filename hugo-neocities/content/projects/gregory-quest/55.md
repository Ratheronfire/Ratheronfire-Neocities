You toss a **rock** into the hole. You put your head close to the hole, paying attention to hear if it hits the bottom. Instead, you hear a loud swish as the **rock** flies out of the hole, right past your head. The **rock** crashes into one of the brambles above you, knocking several branches loose.

Well, that's interesting. Do you still want to peek your head in?
