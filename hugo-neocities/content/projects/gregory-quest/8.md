"*I accept your mission, **Macho Man**,*" you say as you raise your **cream packet** to the sky. You put the **cream** back like a shot. **Macho Man** smiles.

"*I knew you were the right choice for the job, kid. As you already know, your roommate **John Cena** went missing no less than two hours ago. He's mastered some freaky **optical-teleportation-bullshit** that even I don't know. He's getting more powerful by the minute, **Gregory**. You need to stop him before he takes over all of **Wrestlemania**. I'll talk to you again once you're out of the forest.*"

"*And kid... Watch out for **The Rocks**.*" You raise your hand for a fist bump, but **Macho Man** is already gone. In his place is **a pyramid of cream packets**. *Where does he get these!?*

Looks like your mission is clear: Get out of the forest. But which way is out?
