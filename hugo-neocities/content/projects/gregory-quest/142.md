"*Oh yeah, now that we're pretty much all together again I've had a thought. I just have one more thing I'd like to discuss about **Dragon's Hol**...*" Before you can even finish the sentence you hear a deafening \*CRACK\*, immediately followed by a sharp, intense pain surging through the base of your skull. Your ears begin ringing, your vision goes white, and the last thing you feel is your body falling forwards into the dirt as you pass out. 

You awaken an unknown amount of time later to the sound of your allies chatting. Rolling onto your back, you open your eyes to see the rest of your party looking down at you. **The Rock** acknowledges you and extends a hand to help you up. "*Ah, good to see you awake again. I have no idea what happened before, it was as if you suddenly hit your head and passed out.*" While you have no reason not to trust **The Rock**, as you get to your feet you do notice a **new bruise** on the back of his elbow. 

Now back on your feet, you suddenly hear **your guard** call out to you. "*Alright fellas, it's almost time for the **tribunal**. Everyone ready?*"

Is there anything else you wish to say or do before the guard escorts you to the tribunal?

[``> Realize that I should probably ask how this tribunal is going to go down before it actually starts.``](../143)
