You begin walking towards the winding line of people, curious to find out what they’re all queuing up for. Just as you're about to start squeezing past the line into the crowd, a nearby **monk** quickly moves in front of you and extends his arm out, pushing you away from the crowd with some force. 

“*Don't disturb the line. Move to the back.*” The **monk** says in a low tone. You're slightly shocked to actually hear one of the **monks** speak, after all the previous ones gave you the cold shoulder. “*Uhh… sorry?*” You begin to reply, “*I didn't mean to intrude. Who are all these people, and why are they all lined up?*”

The **monk** lowers his arm and relaxes slightly before answering. “*These are refugees from **Wrestlympus**. They were displaced after the disaster. Our order is providing them with food, with an outsider’s assistance. If that is all, please move along.*” You get the sense these **monks** aren't fond of chit chat. 

Will you ask the monk anything else, or move on?
