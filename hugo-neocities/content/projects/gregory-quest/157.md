Recognizing the potential danger, you actually agree with **The Undertaker** for once. "*Alright, you've got a point. Let's hurry up and hide, hopefully whoever's coming hasn't heard any of us.*" With that you and your allies quickly run to the sides of the road and look for cover. You, **The Undertaker** and **The Rock** end up ducking under some shrubs and thicket along the eastern edge of the road, while **Macho Man**, **The Ultimate Warrior** and **El Disgusto** dive into a shallow gully opposite you. **El Disgusto** then uses his **garbagemancy** to pull a layer of moss over the three of them. As prepared as you can be, you all then lie in wait for the approaching **voices**.

It's not long before you begin to see figures approaching from the north, cresting over the top of the hill. You're able to make out a couple dozen **muscular individuals** who appear to be loudly chatting and horsing around with each other as they walk, all seemingly being led by a single, **even larger wrestler**. As the group gets closer you can finally start making out some of the chatter that first alerted you to their presence.

"*Heh, can't wait to reach the **village** and teach those **rockies** a lesson.*" you hear one voice say. "*Yeah, screw **taxes**! I wanna bash some heads in!*" another says in response. "*C'mon **brothers**, pipe down and focus! You all know the rules; **taxes** first, take some **prisoners** if they can't pay up, and bash some **heads** if they start a ruckus.*" you then hear the **leading wrestler** say, shouting over the rest of the crowd. Hang on, is that **Hulk Hogan** and his **hooligans**? From a distance it looks and sounds like him, but in the back of your mind you feel like something's offâ€¦

"*I think it's **Hogan's Hooligans**, sounds like they're gonna try to extort money from the **Rock Tribe**.*" you whisper to **The Undertaker**. You can see him squint to get a better look up the road before whispering back. "*You sure? Something seems off about **Hogan**, and that's aside from the fact that he ain't green anymore. Just shut up and keep your head down, we'll find out soon enough anyways.*"

Soon enough the **marching band of wrestlers** is practically on top of you. It's definitely **Hogan's Hooligans** stomping by, but something is definitely off about their **leader**. It takes you a moment of staring at his face before you finally realize the problem; that isn't **Hulk Hogan**, it's a **Cena clone** with **Hogan's hair and moustache**! It's definitely not a good look for him, but evidently it's convincing enough that the hooligans either don't notice or don't care.

You're currently hiding along the side of the road somewhere north of the **Rock Tribe's compound**. **Hogan's Hooligans** are making their way past you, led by an unconvincing facsimile of **Hulk Hogan**, and they seem to be aiming to attack the **tribe**. What will you do?
