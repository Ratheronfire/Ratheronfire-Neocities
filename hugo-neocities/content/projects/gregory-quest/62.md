"*Thanks for the info, **Mike**, I appreciate it.*" You wave the **barkeep** over. "*Hey, have you seen any visitors around here dressed kind of differently?*" "*Like non-sumos?*" "*Yeah, non-sumos.*" "*Can't say I have, no,*" he says, while drying a glass mug with a rag. "*Not a lot of visitors in these parts who don't want to be sumos.*"

"*In that case, you know where I can find an **inn**?*" "*Right here! We've got rooms upstairs. Cheap, too, only **20 gold** a night,*" says the **barkeep**. You reach to check your pockets, and realize once again that you're wearing **rope underwear**. No pockets there! The **barkeep** notices your lack of cash. "*If you're broke, I can give you a room if you'll help cleaning the bar. Tonight's real busy and I don't want to deal with all of it.*"

Do you accept the offer?
