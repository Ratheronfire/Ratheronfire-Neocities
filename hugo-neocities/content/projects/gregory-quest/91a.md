you see the sleeping face of your **ex-girlfriend Cindy**. She appears to be fast asleep, curled up in bed next to that asshole **Victor** from your **college statistics class** who she dumped you for. Stupid **Victor**, what does he have that you don't have? Sure he has a **successful carreer** at **Microsoft** and a fancy-pants **BMW**, but being an **overnight supermarket manager** is a perfectly valid job and **Toyota Corollas** are just as reliable as any **luxury brand**! Damn **Cindy** to hell, you were just too good for her and...

...Anyways, the vision fades.
