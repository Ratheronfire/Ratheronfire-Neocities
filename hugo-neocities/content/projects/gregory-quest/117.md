“*Okay, first of all how do you guys know my name?*” you ask the **druids**, who gulp down the food in their hands before approaching your party.

{{< rawhtml >}}<p style="text-align: center">{{</ rawhtml >}}
“{{< ethereal 0 >}}We know many things{{</ ethereal >}}”
{{< rawhtml >}}</p>{{</ rawhtml >}}

{{< rawhtml >}}<p style="text-align: center">{{</ rawhtml >}}
“{{< ethereal 1 >}}The meat allows us to see through the veil{{</ ethereal >}}”
{{< rawhtml >}}</p>{{</ rawhtml >}}

{{< rawhtml >}}<p style="text-align: center">{{</ rawhtml >}}
“{{< ethereal 2 >}}We know your name, your goals, your aspirations{{</ ethereal >}}”
{{< rawhtml >}}</p>{{</ rawhtml >}}

{{< rawhtml >}}<p style="text-align: center">{{</ rawhtml >}}
“{{< ethereal 3 >}}But we wish for you to tell us, why have you come to our glade?{{</ ethereal >}}”
{{< rawhtml >}}</p>{{</ rawhtml >}}

Ookay, so it’s a group of **hairy old men in the woods** spying on your every move. Great. Curious that they know all that but still want an explanation for how you got here, but you relent and begin to explain. “*Well we were originally going to **Hollow Hold** to look for one of our missing friends, but we heard your **theme music** playing in the distance. What’s the deal with that, anyways? Why would you play **hypnotic music** and not expect random travelers to show up?*”

{{< rawhtml >}}<p style="text-align: center">{{</ rawhtml >}}
“{{< ethereal 0 >}}Only those who have seen the sacred tapes can hear our music and follow our call{{</ ethereal >}}”
{{< rawhtml >}}</p>{{</ rawhtml >}}

{{< rawhtml >}}<p style="text-align: center">{{</ rawhtml >}}
“{{< ethereal 1 >}}Wrestlemania is in a period of civil war, BBQ pit legends state that a chosen one shall arise during times of crisis such as this{{</ ethereal >}}”
{{< rawhtml >}}</p>{{</ rawhtml >}}

{{< rawhtml >}}<p style="text-align: center">{{</ rawhtml >}}
“{{< ethereal 2 >}}For you to hear the music and come to us, you must be the chosen one of legend{{</ ethereal >}}”
{{< rawhtml >}}</p>{{</ rawhtml >}}

**Chosen one**? These guys seem totally nuts, yet when you look around to your party they all seem completely engrossed by what the supposed **druids** are saying. **The Rock** apparently catches the look of uncertainty in your eye and tries to reassure you. “*What they’re saying is true, **Gregory**. Remember what **Macho Man** and I said when you first met us back in the **forest**. You are our best hope for retaking **Wrestlemania**.*” **The Pit Druids** nod in response.

{{< rawhtml >}}<p style="text-align: center">{{</ rawhtml >}}
“{{< ethereal 0 >}}Yes, you are Wrestlemania’s greatest hope{{</ ethereal >}}”
{{< rawhtml >}}</p>{{</ rawhtml >}}

{{< rawhtml >}}<p style="text-align: center">{{</ rawhtml >}}
“{{< ethereal 1 >}}And we have ways of making you stronger{{</ ethereal >}}”
{{< rawhtml >}}</p>{{</ rawhtml >}}

{{< rawhtml >}}<p style="text-align: center">{{</ rawhtml >}}
“{{< ethereal 2 >}}We can perform the sacred Meat Ritual, and grant you powers to fell even the strongest foes{{</ ethereal >}}”
{{< rawhtml >}}</p>{{</ rawhtml >}}

Your allies collectively gasp at the mention of the phrase “***Meat Ritual***”. This is getting too weird, yet for some reason something in the back of your mind tells you that you can trust these strange druids.

Will you participate in the **ritual**?

[``> Join the druids in their ritual, and ask if they have ever seen Vince or Bubungo with their meat-based divination.``](../118)
