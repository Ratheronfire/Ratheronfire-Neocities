You head east for what seems like hours. You're tired and thinking about sitting down for a rest, but before you do, you see a light in the distance. It's a cabin! Maybe whoever's inside can help you find a way out. Although, a cabin in the middle of a supernatural forest does seem a little suspiciousâ€¦

You are 100 yards from a cabin. What little daylight shines through the forest canopy is quickly dimming. Do you enter the cabin, or go elsewhere?

[``> Run for the cabin as fast as possible.``](../11)
