Unsure of where to begin, you turn to the **The Rock** running the **armory**. “*Our next stop is probably going to be **Wrestlympus**, and from what I saw in my visions it looked like it’s turned into a warzone. What sort of weapons would you recommend for potentially facing down an **army of wax figures**?*” you ask, hoping he might be able to help you find some appropriate weaponry. 

“*I don’t know anything about **wax men**, but if you guys are planning on taking on a whole army by yourselves I’d probably recommend something with a lot of reach. I’ve got a couple **crossbows** tucked away in the back, and you should find some **polearms** and **halberds** on the shelves along the back wall. Sound good?*” the armorer replies, gesturing towards a row of shelves on the far side of the room.

Will you take the equipment the armorer is offering, or continue to browse for more weapons or armor?
