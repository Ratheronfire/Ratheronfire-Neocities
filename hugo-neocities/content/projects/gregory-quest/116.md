You step forward to investigate the **mysterious campsite**, and just as you do you feel **The Rock** place a hand on your shoulder. You look up to him as he pulls you closer and begins to whisper. “*Be careful, **Gregory**. If this is who I think it is, and I have no reason to believe it isn't, this could either be a great boon, or a terrible danger.*” You simply nod your head and mutter “*I know*” in response. 

As you step closer to the **makeshift camp** you notice the whispers becoming louder and almost all-encompassing, and soon it feels as if the voices are speaking directly into your mind. 

{{< rawhtml >}}<p style="text-align: center">{{</ rawhtml >}}
“{{< ethereal 0 >}}He approaches{{</ ethereal >}}”
{{< rawhtml >}}</p>{{</ rawhtml >}}

{{< rawhtml >}}<p style="text-align: center">{{</ rawhtml >}}
“{{< ethereal 1 >}}Yes, the chosen one comes{{</ ethereal >}}”
{{< rawhtml >}}</p>{{</ rawhtml >}}

{{< rawhtml >}}<p style="text-align: center">{{</ rawhtml >}}
“{{< ethereal 2 >}}He has arrived{{</ ethereal >}}”
{{< rawhtml >}}</p>{{</ rawhtml >}}

Hearing these **voices** in the back of your head is disconcerting, and would almost feel threatening if not for their **ridiculous accents**. Nevertheless, you push forward into the camp. 

Once you make your way around the blue tarp, you find yourself face to face with an **eclectic group of men**, all holding **bits of food** and chewing contently. Each man has an impossibly long and bushy **beard**, and is wearing an unusual mix of robes and casual clothing. They are gathered around a large **wooden picnic table**, covered to the brim with a huge array of different **cooked meats**. **Steaks**, **brisket**, **bacon**, **chicken**, **fish** and everything else you could imagine are piled high in front of you, and you can see behind the group even more **meats** roasting on a series of **grills** and **smokers** lining the back of the tent. 

“{{< ethereal 0 >}}Welcome Gregory,{{</ ethereal >}}” you hear a gruff voice say clearly in your mind, despite the individuals in front of you all having their mouths full, “{{< ethereal 1 >}}We are the Barbecue Pit Druids. What brings you to our Barbecue Glade?{{</ ethereal >}}” Wait, how do they know your name?

You are in the **Barbecue Glade**, standing face to face with **The Barbecue Pit Druids**. What will you say to these mysterious individuals? 

[``> Ask how they know my name, and about the music that attracted my party over here.``](../117)
