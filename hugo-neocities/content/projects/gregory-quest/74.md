“*Why is there a **mine** owner in a **treetop village**?*” **Tokidoki** looks at you quizzically. “*No no, **Loincloth** is a **fishing town**, you will see.*” “*Ah, alright. I’ll run the errand for you. Where can I find the **mine** owner?*” “*Look for the **mine**! You will see, you will see. There is a **sandless pit**. You are ready to go?*”
“*Yes, I’m ready.*” And with a wave of his hands, the ground opens up below you. You fall for what feels like hours - but in reality, must be no more than several minutes - before you see a bright light below you. You begin to slow down as you approach the light, and the moment your fall ceases, you realize you’re lying on **hot sand**. No painful thump this time. You immediately prefer this method of travel to **tunnel drink**.

You sit up and observe your surroundings. You’re on a **beach**. There’s a **short grassy hill** opposite the ocean, which extends down the beach until the beach turns a **corner**. No one is around you. There appears to be a **fence** on the hill. Perhaps there’s a **path** nearby.

Do you ascend the **hill**, or walk the **beach**?

[``> Go up and check out the fence.``](../75)
