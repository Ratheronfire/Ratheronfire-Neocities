You begin cleaning the bar, walking around and chatting to bar-goers. Most of your conversations go something like "*How's it hangin' fellas?*" to which the patrons reply, "***DRINKING!!!!***" This is good, yep. Having a fun time.

While cleaning, you find a **folded note** on a barstool. Being the nosy idiot you are, you open the **note** immediately. Expecting some sort of coded message directed at you, you're utterly blindsided by the actual contents of the **note**: 

```
"4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42 are my favite number"
```

Okay. Cool. For a brief moment, you think this could be useful, given your history in this strange land; but decide to throw it away. Seems like trash written by a drunkard.

One hour to go. The patrons begin to clear out, and you notice more **trash** littered around the bar. While cleaning a pile, you find a tip someone left you. Great! You now have five... **Gold coins**?

Upon further inspection, these are **chocolate coins**. Ah well. Do you want to eat the **coins** now, or save them for later?
