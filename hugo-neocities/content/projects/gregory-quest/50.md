"*Why am I here?*" "*That's a very deep question, friend. Who can say? **The universe** places us wherever we were destined to be. And you, evidently, are supposed to be here.*" **The Undertaker** picks up the **orb** in front of you. A sort of cloudy, glittering interior begins to shine through. "*This **orb** told me as much.*"

"*Can it tell me where my friends are?*"

"*Yes, but we must supply **reagents**. I have not the resources to scry. There is a town nearby - should you wish to determine your friends' fates, I suggest you pay them a visit.*" **The Undertaker** winks at you.

You sigh, dreading walking into this town in the nude. Will you travel to the town?

[``> Ask if I can at least borrow his jacket or something, and see if he has any info on the town before I go.``](../51)
