Unfortunately, the entire forest seems to be very wet from last night's rain. There's no dry kindling around you. Looks like you'll have to proceed into the forest unaided.

You walk into the dark. Your eyes adjust and you find that you can see fairly well. After twenty minutes of walking, you stumble upon a steaming bog. In the distance you hear somethingâ€¦

"*Can ... what ... cooking?*"

You can't quite make everything out, but it sounds like someone's having a **nice meal**. You should probably go find them, maybe they know a way out of this forest.

You are on the outskirts of a steaming bog. It looks like you can either make your way around the bog, or try to pass through it.

What will you do?
