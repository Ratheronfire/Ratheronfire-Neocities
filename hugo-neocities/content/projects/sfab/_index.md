    A ~~Twitter~~Mastodon bot which posts randomly generated Scenes From a Hat scene suggestions and awards points to the funniest responses. Written in Python.
    (But, of course, the points don't matter.)
    Also available on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScenesFromABot/), and formerly on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ScenesFromABot).
