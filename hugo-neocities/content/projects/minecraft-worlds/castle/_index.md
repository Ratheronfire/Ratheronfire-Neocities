  title: Main Castle Gate
  text: The main gate into our base. I tried to create a redstone mechanism to lock it, but all I was able to figure out was just pushing that row of specially marked blocks up as an obstacle.

    On the other side of the bridge we have our castle's neglected little brother, stone thing.
