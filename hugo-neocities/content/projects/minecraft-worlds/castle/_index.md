  title: Main Castle Gate
  text: The main gate into our base. I tried to create a redstone mechanism to lock it, but all I was able to figure out was just pushing that row of specially marked blocks up as an obstacle.

  title: Tree Farm
  text: |
    Immediately in front of our castle, we made a tree farm.

    It seemed like a good idea at the time.

  text: |
    On the other side of the bridge we have our castle's neglected little brother, stone thing.

    I don't think we ever used this for anything, though we planned on doing some more development in the direction of that stone brick path, leading to...

  text: After passing through the front gate, you arrive at the entrance to our base proper. I think this update must have been when stained-glass windows were newly added because I used them quite a bit on this build.

    At the other end of the lobby was our bedroom, with a roof made entirely of glass.  

    ...I'm just now realizing that I should've made the empty space above the room into a pool. Can I get a do-over?
