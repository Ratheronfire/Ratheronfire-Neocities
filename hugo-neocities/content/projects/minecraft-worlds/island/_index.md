  text: So this was a bit of an experiment with command blocks that never really worked out. The idea was that standing within the tower would cause you to begin floating up and out through the roof, where you'd have to either fly to safety with an Elytra, or try to land in the water (or land back down on the slime blocks in the tower). Could never figure out the commands to make it work, though.
