     The second iteration of Age of Clicking, written in Unity. The Unity version got a lot further along, though I never really had a clear idea of what I wanted the game to be or how to make it. Not officially cancelled yet (I still think about returning to it from time to time), but I haven't touched this in quite a while now.
