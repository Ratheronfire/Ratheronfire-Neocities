Hey! Guess I might as well put up something here about my ongoing project, a remake of the Homestar Runner game Stinkoman 20X6 in Godot Engine. I started working on this right around December 2020, a little bit after level 10 of the original finally released. Since then I've made quite a bit of progress, with levels 1-8 finished and level 9 well underway.

[Check it out here on my site!](https://ratheronfire.com/stinkoman/) Playable in the browser, as well as in a downloadable form for Windows, Mac, Linux and Android.

For a comparison against the original version plus a few other release showcases, you can take a look at my YouTube channel here:
