And that's level 10.2 in the can. Not much left now: just two bosses, the 10.5 escape sequence, the last few cutscenes, and the credits.

Gotta say, it's pretty surreal to be this close to the finish line. That being said, there's still *so much* I want to do before I can consider this done. But for what it is, this is a pretty big milestone I think.
