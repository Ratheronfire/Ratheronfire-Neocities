For this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) I've decided to start making some writeups on my [Neocities](/) site as I go along as a way of organizing my thoughts and keeping motivated.

*(Naturally, there will be spoilers abound in the writeup pages.)*

I also have some other stuff I've been slowly adding onto my site the past few weeks, if you're interested. I've started mirroring my Letterboxd/Backloggd/whatever else reviews, as well as some of the projects I've worked on the past few years.
