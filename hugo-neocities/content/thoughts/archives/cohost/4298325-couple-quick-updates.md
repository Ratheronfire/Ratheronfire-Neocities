Hey! Been a while since I made a post about my projects, so I thought I'd give a quick update.

I've been slowly updating and fixing the level editor for Stinkoman, though it'll be a while still before it's usable in any real capacity.

I've also started working on a remake of Peasant's Quest recently! I'm expecting/hoping this game won't take quite as long to recreate, but this sort of thing is hard to predict.
