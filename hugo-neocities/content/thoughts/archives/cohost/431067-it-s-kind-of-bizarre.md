It's kind of bizarre to me how wildly varied people's opinions on Sonic Frontiers are. Some people think it's the new best 3D Sonic, but other people talk about it like it's the worst thing Sega's ever done. Personally though, I'm actually having a lot of fun with it. It's got a *lot* of jank and parts that are pretty clearly unfinished/unbalanced, but moving around in that world is just so much fun, even 30+ hours in.
