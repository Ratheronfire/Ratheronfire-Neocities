Made one of those fancy 88x31 buttons for my website! I've also tweaked the css a bit to make it a little less obvious I'm using the same [sadgrl](https://goblin-heart.net/sadgrl/projects/layout-builder/) template as everyone else, as well as adding a few extra themes. I'm not an artist by any means, but I think it looks pretty nice now.
