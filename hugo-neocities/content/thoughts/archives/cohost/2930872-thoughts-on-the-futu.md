So, now that the original game is finally done, what's next? ...I have no idea! I have a lot of ideas I want to pursue for this game, and I definitely want to go back and fix up the level editor, now that my main goal is finished.

There are a lot of other plans I've been floating around: a harder difficulty with new levels, console-accurate palette modes, new playable characters, a randomizer, that sorta thing. Nothing concrete yet of course, but I don't exactly want to put the game aside just yet.

As for what I'll do after Stinkoman, I really don't know yet. I've got the itch to keep going and remaster all the old Homestar games (especially since most of them are much smaller in scope), though I'd also like to do my own original projects too.

The whole reason this project began was so that I could get away from Unity and learn a new engine, so maybe I could use Peasant's Quest to learn Godot 4? Either way I think I'll take a little break - 2023's been an insane year for new games and I'm dying to dive into them.
