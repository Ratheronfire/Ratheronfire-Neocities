Part of me wasn't sure if I'd reach this point, but as of a couple days ago level 10 of the Stinkoman 20X6 remake I've been working on is now done, barring a few odd glitches and issues I still have to iron out.

---

As for the rest of it, I still have to add the level 10 cutscenes (which is daunting because those ones are way over the top), plus the end credits crawl, but the gameplay is fully complete now. I also want to enhance the time attack experience a bit more by giving the last few bosses unique death animations, as well as making a Power Crunched version of 1-Up to match Stinkoman - not really much of an art guy, but I had an idea of giving him giant hologram arms or something dumb like that.

...And I guess eventually I do actually have to finish up the title screen animations and the attract mode stuff. Funny how that's shaping up to be the thing I do after finishing the rest of the game.

Once I finish up the main game, there's still a whole lot I want to do. No promises, but there are a few ideas I've been kicking around for a while:

- Going back and redoing the level editor
- Randomizer mode
- Extra hard mode (maybe I'll give the player a charge/slide/whatever else, plus harder level layouts and more complicated bosses?)
- A unique postgame level, sorta like the bonus stuff from Mega Man 9/10
- New characters? I've had ideas for Pan-Pan and maybe something with Marzi-Mei using Cheatball as a weapon.

Of course my big/probably not going to happen wish is to get this game published in some official capacity with TBC on Steam/itch or whatever, but I'm not holding my breath. Even if that never happens, I do want to at least make the full game available in some permanent form once it's done, which is looking more and more tangible every day.
