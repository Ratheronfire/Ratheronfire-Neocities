A recent hobby I've acquired (inspired a fair bit by things like the RTVS Cameclam streams) is digging up obscure old YouTube videos from the early days, videos that probably haven't been seen by anyone in close to twenty years, still just sitting up there on some long forgotten corner of YouTube's servers.

I've been amassing a playlist of anything that I found particularly interesting, noteworthy, or just too funny not to include, which you can find here:

My goal isn't to make fun of the videos (even if a lot of them are unintentionally hilarious), but to celebrate the brief window of history when internet culture began rapidly expanding in the hands of a generation fully unprepared for the changes they were all undergoing.

Some of the highlights I've found include:

* [This inexplicable Mario & Luigi montage set to 15 second clips of the beginning of a bunch of randomly selected songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLvKi081_sM)
* [An old man delivering his best dad joke material](https://youtu.be/tkisenyXxek)
* [Extreme low-budget filmmaking, uploaded in several 2-3 minute chunks](https://youtu.be/bDUC3t-PmvY)
* [A whole two seconds of animation](https://youtu.be/9iHcRV1FBcI)
* [Someone trying to record RuneScape footage with an unregistered Hypercam 2, but instead only getting a few seconds of their desktop with what I assume is a cheat client visible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldJs1Elb6NI)
* [This clip which is actually a pretty good bit](https://youtu.be/cszlT2GQv9o)
* [A bunch of drunk college kids dancing and screaming about nothing in barely readable 240p](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRWYt45jfuE)
* [What I can only assume is a clip from that new Miyazaki movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl18PUGb2EI)
* [Nearly 6 minutes of someone trying to blend a Windows 98 CD, half of which is them awkwardly attempting to slice it in half with a massive knife](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oBNkwrEgHQ)
* [And maybe my absolute favorite, this absolutely incomprehensible 144p, 5 second clip of somebody screening into the camera, shaking it wildly, and saying something about Eggman?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_UR8DPAmgc)

If you're curious about finding videos like this, here's my general approach.  

* I'll think of some random word or phrase and enter it in the search bar along with `before:2007`. You can also change the before date to target different years, but I usually spend most of my time looking at stuff uploaded in the first year or so of YouTube (basically, anything from mid-2005 to early 2007 is good IMO).
  * It might be possible to search for videos before a specific date, but it seems a bit more finnicky, and unfortunately YouTube doesn't really document their advanced search terms anywhere so I'm not sure what date format they're looking for.
* Once I have a good search I'll open up the filters menu and change the sorting to Upload Date or Rating, which usually gets me the best results. The other options tend to only give you the most popular videos, which tend to be a lot less interesting.
  * There are other filtering options you can mess with, but most of the features you can filter on don't really apply to videos this old, aside from video length.
