Decided to upload a couple alternative cuts of the Stinkoman reveal trailer, with some music differences.

This one used the ingame level 10 music in place of the remix. While I think the final version is paced a lot better, there's one key moment of musical serendipity in this version that I'm still in love with.

For this version I included a fantastic mandolin duet cover of the level 1 music for the ending fadeout, made by [VoodooPupMusic](https://twitter.com/VoodooPupMusic) and [AustinNebbia](https://twitter.com/AustinNebbia) for the [Decemberweenvent Calendar](https://homestarrunner.com/toons/decemberweenvent-calendar) last year.

If you want to check out more of their covers (and you should, they're really good), you can find them here:
