I'm of course referring, as we all know so well, to the landmark Babylon 5 season 1 episode Babylon Squared, where the crew of the Babylon 5 station has to mount a rescue mission for the crew of the Babylon 4 station, thought to have been destroyed until it mysteriously re-appeared out of a temporal rift.

So, as we always say on this most important day, "Hey, remember that time the Babylon 5 crew went to Babylon 4? That was pretty crazy, right?"
