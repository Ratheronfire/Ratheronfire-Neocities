Guess it was only a matter of time, but it's still a bit sad knowing this website is reaching the end soon. If you want to keep seeing my one or two posts per year, I have a few different places set up:

* [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/ratheronfire.com)
* [My Neocities website](https://ratheronfire.com/)
* [A Discord server I set up for some of my projects](https://discord.gg/M6rgZVkVuv) (I mainly use it as a secondary source of information/a place for casual conversation, but the projects themselves are usually hosted primarily on other platforms.)
* [My YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Ratheronfire) I'll occasionally post updates on my projects here, plus a handful of really old videos I'm too attached to to delete. (Been thinking about other stuff I want to post here, maybe highlight reels of some streamers I follow? Is that a thing? Should I do that?)
* [My itch.io page](https://ratheronfire.itch.io/) (Mostly dormant for the moment, but I have a couple things I want to get on there sooner or later).
* My Neocities page has links to a few other pages where I have accounts, but these are the primary ones.

I'm also going to try and put out one last post summarizing all the stuff I've been working on recently, for posterity's sake.

Weirdly sad seeing this place go, it truly feels so unlike just about every other social media platform out there. Gonna miss it, even if I was never quite as active as I meant to be.
