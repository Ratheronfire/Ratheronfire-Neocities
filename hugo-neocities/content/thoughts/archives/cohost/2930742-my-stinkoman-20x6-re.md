After nearly three years, it's finally time: My Godot remake of Stinkoman 20X6 is complete! Every level, every cutscene, and a whole lot more. To celebrate, I've put together a little trailer.

You can get the game now at [https://ratheronfire.com/projects/stinkoman/](/projects/stinkoman/) for Windows/Mac/Linux/Android, and it's also playable in the browser.

Before I talk too much about the game itself, I want to give some thanks to all the people who either helped me along, or whose work made this project possible.

First, of course, is the good folks at [Homestar Runner Dot Com](https://twitter.com/strongBadActual/) - Mike & Matt Chapman and Jonathan Howe who made the original game, as well as [jezzamonn](https://twitter.com/jezzamonn) , who finally brought it to a close with level 10, and the oh-so-mysterious U.Z. Inu who composed the soundtrack for the final level.

On the subject of music, I'd also like to thank [Gfdgsgxgzgdrc](https://twitter.com/Gfdgsgxgzgdrc) who surprised me out of the blue with some incredible remasters of the compressed tracks from the Flash version. Their new versions I think really help make the whole package feel complete.  
You can see more of their work over at [their Scratch page](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/CoolGuyBug/).

I'd also like to thank Souperion and Wassup Thunder for allowing me to use their amazing [Stinkoman remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJOakHVciLE) as part of the soundtrack to the release trailer.

Next, I want to thank the members of my Discord server who tested the game, as well as for being generally a part of the community: [fortran](https://cheeselandrestaurant.neocities.org/), ChrisHighwind, [PetrarchEleven](https://twitter.com/PetrarchEleven), KirbychuHRD, and retroshaffer. Thanks for all of your help.

Lastly, I want to give special, personal thanks to a long-time friend of mine, KirbychuHRD, who helped make sure this game kept moving along, even at times when I had no idea just how far I was going to end up bringing it.

He spent an unbelievable amount of time playtesting knowing that I had no real means to pay him for it, and gave me so many clever ideas and suggestions all throughout these three years, as well as helping redeisgn some of the original art to suit the new engine.

Everyone who's supported me all this time, everyone who's followed my sporadic updates, everyone whose work helped make this possible: Thank you, truly. It means more to me than you could imagine.

All that aside, what exactly is new in this version? Well... a lot, actually! Aside from level 10 in its full glory, I've also put in a whole bunch of bugfixes, QoL improvements, and extra polish all throughout the game.

I've also added a lot of different parts of the original package that didn't exist until this version - the attact mode, the manual, and a whole bunch of other minor things I forgot along the way.

Also, with this version of the game the hidden time attack and boss rush modes are now fully complete, and I've also made them and the other extras visible but locked until beating certain levels. There's also the level editor, which is still very, very incomplete.

And of course, it wouldn't be properly Homestar Runner without a few secrets hidden throughout! Most of them are pretty minor and (I think) quite a bit obscure, so I'm curious to see if anyone can find them.

EDIT: Guess I probably should've gotten rid of some of the twitter handles when I copied this over, huh
