The last project I want to highlight is Age of Clicking, a game that I've been picking away at since 2018. It's taken several forms over the years from a browser-based idle game to now a Godot project. At the moment the game is still far from finished, but it's something that I've wanted to see through to the end for quite a while, whatever that end might be.

I've written a bit about Age of Clicking's history in one of my previous summary posts, so if you want more specific details you can find that in [this post](/thoughts/archives/cohost/7615144-my-recent-ish-projec).

The basic idea of the game in its current form is somewhere in the middle of Rimworld, Cookie Clicker, RuneScape, and tower defense (although it's much more basic in scope than that description implies). You're given control of a number of pawns who can harvest resources such as logs and ores, collect them at their base, and process them into other resources.

In addition to resources there are also a series of upgrades, which together form kind of a loose progression tree. Resources are spent to unlock upgrades which in turn allow pawns to harvest new resources, eventually progressing into the endgame resources, which... Basically mean nothing currently. I've never gotten far enough along with the project to finalize my concept for the endgame, but my rough idea was that eventually you would gain the ability to reanimate the ents populated around the edges of the map, which would then serve as more powerful units.

I've also thought about adding combat to the game, in the form of enemy waves like you'd see in a tower defense game, or something like Terraria. There was also an idea of looter enemies, who would attack your constructions and try to steal resources. Right now, though, enemies don't do a whole lot save for wandering around their spawn points.

For the newest version, I've started incorporating some of the newer ideas I've had in the years since the game first started taking shape.

For one, I'm making the trading system somewhat more robust. Originally, you had a UI that allowed you to sell X amount of Y resource, and one of your pawns would bring those resources to a trading post. In the newest version market values fluctuate over time, and every 24 hours a rotating stock of buyable resources is made available. In the future I'd also like to add unique items which can be bought from the store, as well as the ability to hire new pawns.

I've also begun designing a new trait system. At the start of the game, pawns will be generated with up to 3 unique traits, with varying effects. Some beneficial, some detrimental, and some that are just for fun. Things like "harvest this kind of resource faster, lower walk speed, higher xp gain, make some stupid sound every time the pawn performs an action", that sorta thing. Hopefully it'll make each playthrough somewhat unique, with the player being given different variables to play with each time.

I think that's about all I have on Age of Clicking at the moment. I've been treating it as just a fun toy to experiment with it, so it doesn't really have an end goal in mind. Maybe it'll never be done! But that's fine I think. Most of the fun of this game for me has been designing a system where I can just let my pawns go about their business and zone out watching them. I think there's some value in that.

...So, I think this is going to be the last thing I write for Cohost. I haven't been here super long, but stepping away from it feels hard now. It's a good thing I've got [my website](/) now, because I'm not interested in stopping any time soon. Even if nobody's reading, I'm gonna keep putting my words down.

Thanks for reading. Thanks for playing my games, if you've played any of them. Thanks for being Cohost.
