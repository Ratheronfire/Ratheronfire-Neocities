Completed A Kingdom Divided and Song of the Elves over the past week or so and it made me realize...  
Man, I really missed this kind of storytelling.

I've mostly fallen off of RS3 since around 2020ish so getting into OSRS seriously for the first time feels like coming home again. There's a part of me that still wants to go back and see the new stuff they've been adding but that game's become a bit hard to return to for me lately.
