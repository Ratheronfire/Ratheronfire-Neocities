For my next writeup, I want to highlight some of the stuff I've added to [my Neocities page](/) over the past year or so.

When this started up, it was just a basic landing page for a handful of my projects, but once I discovered [this template](https://goblin-heart.net/sadgrl/projects/layout-builder/) I decided to make it into something bigger.

I quickly realized that copying the base template over to each subpage would be too much of a hassle, so soon after I decided to start using the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to make my life easier... except what actually happened is that it led to me making my site way, way, more complicated than it needed to be.

But hey, that's the fun part! (If you're a developer sicko like me at least)

Once I had the basic components in place, I started by archiving some posts me and some friends made on our private subreddit for dumping random thoughts, like [the time I tried to retell the plot of Metal Gear from memory without double checking anything](/thoughts/jnd/mgs_1/). Next, I started archivng stuff from other sources like [my Letterboxd reviews](/thoughts/reviews/movies/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-two-towers/), using a modified version of this [Letterboxd review formatter](https://nex-3.com/cohost-letterboxd/) by [@nex3](https://cohost.org/nex3). I also started making writeups for my solutions to the yearly [Advent of Code programming challenges](/thoughts/adventofcode/2023/day10/), and some other assorted pages like [me gushing about the Sonic Symphony](/thoughts/unorganized/sonicsymphony/). Just whatever I felt like putting up in the moment. I also added [tags](/tags/) to all my pages, because organizing things is fun.

I'm also using this site as the primary home for a couple shared writing projects that my friends and I (mostly my friends honestly) have been working on, namely [Grafald](/projects/grafald/) and [Gregory Quest](/projects/gregory-quest/). Read at your own peril; they're both **really** dumb.

Out of everything I've made, I think I'm most proud of the interactive walk-throughs I made for [a few Minecraft worlds](/projects/minecraft-worlds/castle/#0) me and my friends played on. I designed them as sort of a slideshow with arrows connecting all the screenshots I took, with commentary added throughout. Only the first world is done so far but I have a lot more I want to add.

I also have RSS feeds available! You can subscribe to [this feed](/index.xml) to see every newly added page, or [this feed](/updates.xml) for just the highlights.
