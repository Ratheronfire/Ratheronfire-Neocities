With romhacking.net seemingly not long for this world, I figured now was a good time to make a post for my [Mega Man 2 romhack](/projects/mega-man-qol-fixes/) from a couple years back.

---

It adds a couple of nice quality of life improvements, including:

* The Energy Balancer feature from later Mega Man games
* Preserving E-Tanks on death, as well as preventing accidentally wasting E-Tanks if your health is already full
* Increased E-Tank limit (including a tweak to the pause menu UI to accomodate having > 4 E-Tanks)
* A fix for Quick Man occasionally getting stuck in walls
* Other extremely minor fixes

Since some of the changes can affect the game's balance in fairly large ways, I've included partial patches for each of my changes, as well as some less overpowered versions where appropriate.

I've also started writing some devlogs explaining my changes and how I developed them, and you can find the first one [here](/thoughts/devlogs/romhacks/mm2_1/).
