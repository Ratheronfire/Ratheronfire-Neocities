Folks, it happened again. I got emotionally invested in an improvised Minecraft RP stream. This time around it was [Royal Royale](https://royalroyale.carrd.co/), a seven-day event run by [Duke of Ash](https://dukeofash.carrd.co/) and a few other contributors. The structure was fairly straightforward: Players were seprated into three main teams (as well as a handful of independent players, called the Vagabonds), namely the Green, Gold, and Purple Kingdoms. Each team is given a portion of the map to explore, with barriers separating them. Each of the regions has a castle with a large pillar in its core, which enables respawns for that team while it's active, and makes deaths permanent after it's destroyed.
