*So this post was originally supposed to go up in late December and also cover a lot more than just movies, but a \*ton\* of stuff came up that distracted me, so I'm just gonna break it up into multiple parts so I can finally get at least something posted.*

Since it's already that time of year again, I thought I'd sit down and write up a quick post about some of the stuff I've enjoyed over the past year. Of course, because I'm me, that immediately devolved into listing out just about every little thing I've experienced, and condemning myself to hours of effort for what could've been a 10 minute task.

But it's fun, and isn't that what matters? Probably not but I'm doing it anyway.

### Poor Things

This was the first new movie I saw in theaters this year, and I liked it, I guess? It's hard for me to have really strong feelings about it because I didn't really get that much out of it compared to what everyone online was saying. I saw this mostly on a whim, and while I definitely don't regret seeing it, I probably wouldn't have minded missing out on it either.

Not to come across as too much of a prude, but I think I generally just don't enjoy watching sex scenes, and this movie was *full* of them. I think finding them unpleasant was kind of the point, but even so it felt like there just wasn't a ton for me to enjoy. I liked the weird dreamlike imagery and all the scenes where Willem Dafoe got to be a weird little goblin man, and I did like their sort of modern-ish retelling of Frankenstein, if you can even call it that with how different it is. Also I feel like it could've ended around 20 or so minutes sooner, because the last-minute twist to me felt a bit too out of nowhere and didn't really go anywhere interesting.

### Dune Parts 1 & 2

I've never read any of the Dune books, so I went into these with very little expectations, other than having a general sense of Villeneuve's directorial style from Blade Runner 2049. That being said, I really enjoyed this interpretation (even though from what I've been told, they more or less completely ignore the Arabic influences on the original story). I saw Part 2 in IMAX and the sheer scope of everything from the imagery to the deafening soundtrack just floored me.

I really enjoyed the subversion of the sort of white savior chosen one trope here, with events being manipulated hundreds of years in advance to manufacture a scenario where Paul would be able to seize power for his house, and I love that these movies are 100% explicitly clear that what he's doing is wrong, and that everyone is going to suffer as a result of it. There were bits in the first movie where it felt like they were leaning towards a more sympathetic angle, but by the end of the second it's clear that Paul is fully responsible for his actions and that he is to blame for what's to come.

Apparently one of the later books has a giant sand worm with a dude's head and I hope that gets filmed someday.

### Planet of the Apes

Me and some friends have been running [movie nights](https://letterboxd.com/ratheronfire/list/extralives-movie-nights/) for 2-3 years now, and earlier this year we took a look at the Planet of the Apes series, old and new. Before this I had seen maybe a third of the original, but other than that (and the one bit from The Simpsons) I had very little prior knowledge.

The original is of course an all-time great, with its unfolding mystery and exploration of ape culture, the examination of religion, and of course the final reveal that I'm sure everyone knows by now. Based on the bits of the later movies I'd heard of, I expected the remainder of the original set of films to be in so-bad-it's-good territory, but they're surprisingly enjoyable, and every bit as dark as the original (arguably more, honestly). They also go to some really weird places I couldn't possibly have predicted.

The newer run of movies is also quite solid but they're very different movies. There's not quite as much focus on the cultural/religious exploration and a lot more focus on evolving social dynamics among the apes as they begin to form into a full-on society. The change from apes evolving by way of domestication to instead being mutated by a virus is interesting, even if a part of me really misses the complete nonsense explanation the original movies cooked up to explain how apes inherited the Earth. {{<sup "down" 1 >}}

### Alien

As part of our weekly movie night we also watched the Alien series, which I had never seen. Not really into horror generally, but something about Alien just works for me.

Frankly, I don't even really consider these horror movies for the most part. They definitely have huge horror elements, but I see them more as just action stories set in space, I guess. There's also quite a lot of commentary, particularly in the older movies where I don't think the corporation that's after the Xenomorph even gets a name at first. There's a lot I appreciate about the newer movies, but the one element I really miss from the original is "the corporation" being this massive faceless entity that everyone knows as such a matter of fact that there's no need to even specify it by name.

These movies are way grosser than I expected, too. Guess I should've seen that coming, but man.

### Interstellar

*(If you haven't been able to tell already, I'm super late to the party on a lot of media.)*

I finally saw this movie for its 10th anniversary, when it came back to IMAX theaters. I'm sure opinions on this movie have been over-discussed to oblivion since it came out, but I have to say that I *really* liked it.

Liking Nolan movies feels weirdly frustrating, because any time I say I like his stuff I feel like I look like the obnoxious film nerd stereotype. I do just like a lot of his movies, though I would hardly call him my favorite director. I recognize that he's generally pretty bad at writing women who exist beyond a singular character trait, and a lot of his stuff is style over substance, but generally speaking I just like a lot of what he does.

This movie was exhausting. Three solid hours of the most harrowing drama I've ever seen that somehow managed to find a way to end on an optimistic note. The ending seems very polarizing from the little I've read, but I don't see how you could end this any other way, personally.

### Sonic the Hedgehog 3

Now **THIS** is cinema.

Okay, yeah, I'm biased here. But I really liked this movie! The first Sonic is... fine, I guess, nothing amazing but it gets the job done. The second is an improvement in some ways, taking more direct inspiration from other Sonic media and setting up stuff for the third, but it still relied too heavily on the human cast, and had basically nothing of note in the soundtrack department.

This time around though it feels like they're finally figuring out what these movies should be. The tension between Sonic and Shadow is treated seriously, the tragedy of Maria's death is about as heavy as they realistically could've gotten away with, and there was *just* enough screentime from the humans to not feel like they overstayed their welcome. And they finally used actual Sonic music for their grand finale setpiece!

Still not sure how I feel about Jim Carrey's take on Gerald. I think it's less that his take is more joke-y than the game version than the fact that Gerald is alive in general. There was just no way this movie was going to get close to that level of darkness, considering that Gerald's final moments in the original were him delivering his manifesto about his desire to lay waste to humanity just before being executed by a military firing squad. If these movies couldn't let Shadow swear, there was never any way they were going to be allowed to go *that* dark.

The sequence with the gravity panels was a lot of fun. Very Mission Impossible-eque (you can tell, because the movie made that reference themselves). But the final ~15 minutes? Unbelievable. For a minute there I was 10 again, experiencing the ending of Sonic Adventure 2 for the first time all over again. They even found an opportunity for Eggman to ~~piss on~~ laser the moon!

That song over the credits was pretty bad. Ending on a dud of a song when you're working on a Sonic property is basically a war crime if you ask me.

### The War of the Rohirrim

I'm not sure why we're suddenly getting so much Tolkien stuff (I'm lying, it's money) but when I heard that a Lord of the Rings anime was in the work, I was curious, if nothing else. Admittedly I've never been very big on anime, and I could probably count the number of shows I've seen front to back on one hand, so my interest in this movie was way more on the Tolkien side than anything else.

I didn't have super high expectations going in, so I was pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable this movie was. It being set so many years before even The Hobbit let them stick to telling their own story (though of course they couldn't escape the inevitable camera winking towards the end). From what I understand this story is *very* loosely based on elements from the LOTR appendices, with some amount of embellishment for the sake of the story (I don't think the main character even had a name originally).

The artstyle was pretty nice for the most part, but whenever they would try to mix in 3D elements the style clash really took me out of it. It's a shame, because when the visual style works, it *really* works, especially a scene fairly early on with this half-decomposed elephant that's reminiscent of something out of Nausicaa. There were also a lot of wide shots of landscapes where I couldn't tell if it was CG, hand painted, or just live action footage disguised with a filter, but either way it still just felt out of place.

Ultimately this movie isn't really necessary, but I enjoyed it for what it was. I'm not sure how well it'd work on someone who isn't already a fan of Tolkien or more specifically the Peter Jackson films, but I was happy with it.

So, that's the first of who knows how many 2024 year in review posts done, and it only took me just under two months!

surely I'll have the rest of these done in no time (not a chance)

{{< sup "up" 1 >}} For the uninitiated, a virus brought to earth by astronauts renders cats and dogs extinct, so humans decide to domesticate apes to cure their loneliness, and somehow just being domesticated is enough to cause apes to rapidly develop intelligence and mount an armed resistance within maybe 5 years?
