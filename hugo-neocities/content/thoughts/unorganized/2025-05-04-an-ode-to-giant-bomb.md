> ***EDITED 5/11/24 -- NEVERMIND WE'RE GOOD NOW, GIANT BOMB FOREVER AND ALL THAT***

------

*It was a website about video games.*

Well, seems like it's finally happening. After 17-odd years, numerous hosts joining and departing, and an unimaginable amount of videos, it appears that Giant Bomb is facing its final days, being run aground by soulless corporate executives motivated only by lines on graphs without any concern for the reality hiding behind those numbers. If you had told me a few years ago, when I was listening to the Giant Beastcast week after week that the site which occupied so much of my mind would soon get scooped up by Fandom and gutted for spare parts, I'm not sure I'd believe you.

Of course, I knew Giant Bomb couldn't last forever, but I thought it would fade out gradually as the personalities grew older and began seeking other projects and life goals. Instead, it's been unceremoniously chopped down, just as the new crew running it was beginning to really find their stride. Admittedly I've been watching the site less and less the past few years, but from the few times I checked in it was clear the site was still in good hands, even if the face of Giant Bomb was very different from what I fell in love with. Unfortunately, they just weren't brand-safe enough, so now Fandom is ~tossing them aside in order to appease the brands~ ["actively exploring creative directions for the future of GB"](https://bsky.app/profile/giantbomb.bsky.social/post/3lo55ow25dc2a).

I've never been a very active member of the larger Giant Bomb community, but over the past few days I've been finding myself wishing that I had been, because the outpouring of love, friendship, and mutual sadness over the loss of our beloved website has been a beautiful thing to witness. I think it's just kind of in my nature to avoid actively contributing to larger communities, as much as I know I would benefit from being more open to them. That said, I have contributed some small amount of time and effort to the Giant Bomb Preservation Society, which has helped to preserve Giant Bomb's legacy through the mirror of their video catalog at https://duders.zone/ as well as the 24/7 channel [Giant Bomb Forever](https://www.twitch.tv/giantbombforever) on Twitch. I guess in a small way I managed to leave my mark on Giant Bomb's history, now that I think about it. That's pretty cool.

I don't have a ton of deep thoughts left to share about Giant Bomb, so instead I'd like to share some of the moments that have permanently lodged themselves in my brain, in no particular order.

## Best of Giant Bomb 44 - Beep Beep

{{< youtube id="crw0UYdugBE" class="yt yt-right" >}}

So I think this was the first Giant Bomb video I saw? In a way this video is kind of the perfect encapsulation of what Giant Bomb was to me: irreverent, experimental, lighthearted, and just damn funny. They derived so much joy out of hosing down a bear, driving through the biggest zoo known to man, and the indelible stain on the soul of humanity that is Angry Birds Star Wars Kinect.

***DEAL WITH IT, BEAR***

## Australian Beef

{{< youtube id="RPPPeyflV5I" class="yt yt-right" >}}

Over the course of several months, Australian writers in to the Bombcast fired volley after volley at one another to deterime which of them were the true garbage people. Few survived the ensuing carnage, and those that did would never be the same.

## #WEED3

{{< youtube id="XZY8UA1KpjY" class="yt yt-right" >}}

Giant Bomb made E3 something truly special. The period this video was from is maybe the apex of Giant Bomb for me, when Giant Bomb East began crystallizing into something special under the watchful eyes of Vinny, Alex, and of course Austin Walker, who elevated Giant Bomb's ability to think critically about not just the games but also the larger political climate they existed in (and also he is one of the funniest people to ever work in games media).

## Inca

Bye, space flute.

## Executable

Sadly I missed out on the Ryan era of Gaint Bomb, but moments like this are just timeless. It's not hard to see why Ryan Davis was so beloved, and why his loss is still felt deeply in the community to this day.

There were a ton of these animated podcast snippets, but these are the maybe the ones I revisit the most. The chemistry between all the podcast folks is simply unrivaled.

## Jeremiah

Jeremiah drops by Giant Beastcast HQ for a brief conversation. Only a brief conversation though, he's a busy man with a salary and a wife after all!

Wow, that was a lot more than I thought it was gonna be. I could easily make ten more of these posts but this page is already getting pretty unweildy as it is. I didn't even get to include Dan tormenting the others with unholy nacho cheese meals, the Mario Party Partys, that time John Vignocchi tweeted Dave Lang's phone number, Austin spotting the Faker, Dan's dream of becoming an in-play racquetball...

There's so much.

Truly, this was a website.
