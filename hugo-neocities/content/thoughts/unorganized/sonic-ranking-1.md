{{< load-photoswipe >}}

So about a year ago I got the idea in my head that I should replay and rank all the Sonic games, and try to create my definitive personal ranking as I went.

...I got about 2 games in, I think? Probably would've gotten a lot further if I didn't force myself to also try and get all the RetroAchievements along the way, because some of them are downright ridiculous. {{< sup "down" 1 >}}

I did manage to master Sonic 1 and 2 (and Adventure 1, which I played out of order) at least, and those were no joke. Especially the newer Sonic 1 achievements which were added after I mastered it, particularly the dreaded deathless run.

They were fun, though! Getting through the last handful of achievements gives me a feeling that not much else in gaming really compares to, even if it really starts to get rough with some of the more involved sets.

All that aside, I thought it'd be fun to do a quick writeup for all the games I've beaten along the way, as a way of putting into words why I've decided to rank them all where I did. (Since this is the first volume I'm going to cover everything I've played over the past couple years, so it's gonna be a bit scattershot.)

## Sonic 1

In my head, Sonic 1 was always the rough first draft for the games to come after it, which would figure out how to make Sonic actually work. I mostly remembered Sonic 1 for its slow, frustrating platforming, and for being a lot more linear than later games. After playing it again, though, while all that stuff is certainly there I realized that there's still a lot to enjoy in the first game. Green Hill Zone is fantastic, of course, but in playing it again I really appreciated how the levels as a whole had kind of a nice flow to them. Fast paced for Green Hill, then slow and careful for Marble, fast again for Spring Yard, slow for Labyrinth... It feels like even this early on they were starting to figure out how to play with the momentum of the gameplay in interesting ways.

There's also a lot more hidden paths than I realized, like the hidden platform that lets you skip basically the entirety of Labyrinth 1. Honestly, the only portions that really frustrate me still are the handful of segments in Marble Zone where you have to ride the stone platforms over the lava, but even then you can skip past at least a couple of them if you know the level layout well enough.

The boss fights in this one are... fine, I guess. A whole lot of "Robotnik flies about while you dodge other stuff and try to jump at him". Not really a big fan of the final fight either, it feels awkward to play even when you know how to do it, and it doesn't really feel as exciting as a final fight should.

Overall, Sonic 1 is way more fun than I've given it credit for. I think it'd be remembered way more fondly if it was just a one-off without its better sequels to overshadow it.

## Sonic 2

Sonic 2 is one of my favorite games of all time.

Is that nostalgia talking? Maybe. Probably. I don't really care, Sonic 2 was great as a kid and it's just as good now.

I love everything about this game. The music, the art direction, the controls, the level design, the 20+ years of investigation into the game's development, all of it.

Sonic 2, in my opinion, is just about the gold standard of balancing difficulty, momentum, tension, and fun factor in a game like this. Every level feels like a natural progression over the last, and it builds up to a much more satisfying conclusion than the first game. I'm saying this as someone who agrees that Metropolis and Wing Fortress are extremely annoying, but I think I kinda *like* that they're so annoying. It makes the game feel more... real to me, I guess?

The hitboxes on the final boss suck.

## Sonic Adventure

~Sonic had a rough tr~ nah we're not doing that

This game rules.

It's easy to forget just how much of modern Sonic was established in this game, from the homing attack to the refined character designs to the mission based gameplay with unique character-specific objectives to, well, Crush 40. This game's soundtrack has had a permanent place in my music library pretty much as long as I've had one.

I'll admit, for a while I got caught up in the whole "the Adventure games haven't aged well" anti-hype, but since then I went back and actually replayed it and remembered that it's actually just fun. The real trick, as I've learned, is to *constantly* hammer the spindash button and send yourself flying across the world. Really, I think that's kind of the secret sauce of Sonic gameplay: it's all about learning enough about the controls and the level layout to figure out how fast you can go and how far you can push yourself without dying.

All the different gameplay modes are a lot of fun once you figure out how they tick. (Big's is pretty boring admittedly, but once you know how to actually do the fishing it's mostly fine.) There's so much more I could say, but [Liam Triforce's retrospective video](https://youtu.be/7dh1be2O_ls?t=620) says it better than I ever could, so I'm gonna just redirect you there. It's a long watch, but I think it's worth it.

The [RetroAchivements set](https://retroachievements.org/game/3416) for this game was a lot of fun. The majority of the objectives were straightforward 100%ing goals, but there were some unique challenges like time attacks, 1-up collection, and a couple light sequence breaks. The Chao Garden stuff was a pain, but once I had a good strategy for brute-forcing my way to a max-stat Chao it was pretty simple. The [subset](https://retroachievements.org/game/22863) for the Dreamcast DLC was a fun afternoon, too.

E-102's story is great and I won't hear any arguments to the contrary.

## Sonic Superstars

Not a big fan of this one. It's... okay?

The game's fun to play and unlike some of the other attempts at adapting classic Sonic to a 3D artstyle, it feels just about right physics-wise, but overall the game feels really half-baked. The level design gets the job done for the most part, but the presentation is a little lacking.

Like what most people say about this game, the two biggest problems for me are the music, and the boss fights. And I like a good half to two thirds of the soundtrack! But the Sonic 4 sounding tracks stick out like a sore thumb, and realy make this game feel like it's just made out of whatever scraps Jun Senoue had on hand from those days.

As for the boss fights, it feels like they didn't really understand what made boss fights work in the originals. In those games, boss fights tended to be over fairly quickly because the thing that set the pacing of the fight was Eggman's positioning, and the player's ability to maneuver towards him and to fit in as many attacks as possible in the windows provided. In Superstars? You get an opportunity to attack every 30 seconds, then you have to dodge attacks for another 30. Over and over and over. And naturally dying means restarting from scratch. For what it's worth, I think the issue is a *little* overblown. It's only really a problem with the last fight's overly long attack phases, but I didn't have a huge amount of trouble with it for whatever reason.

Without spoiling too much, the true final boss is also a pretty frustrating experience. On paper it's not too bad, but the game does a pretty poor job of communicating what it expects the player to do. Not a big deal once you know, but knowing is a very difficult thing.

## The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog

This was a pleasant surprise! When this game was first announced I assumed it was a joke, like most other April Fool's Day visual novel announcements (wouldn't be the first time [an unconventional Sonic game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_%26_Sonic_at_the_Olympic_Games) was announced on April Fool's, after all).

I'm typically not the target audience for visual novels, especially not romance visual novels, but this was right up my alley. It was funny, it was well written, and the art was fantastic. It kinda reminds me of the old Telltale games from the Sam & Max/SBGC4AP{{< sup "down" 2 >}} era, which is a market the games industry could always use more of if you ask me.

Not much else to say. It's fun! There's definitely going to be a clue in one of the trash cans!

## Sonic Frontiers

Man. **Man.** Sonic Frontiers. I can't really say why, but I loved this game. None of it should work, and yet it does. I think this game singlehandedly re-ignited my love of Sonic, which has been a bit dormant the past few years.

I think this game is the ultimate proof that playing as Sonic is just inherently fun, because removing him from the context of "get to the end goal ring" and placing him in a massive playground of level elements to run and jump on still made for an experience that I just couldn't put down.

I expected that I really wouldn't like the subdued atmosphere of the game, but somehow it kinda feels right? (Okay, I gotta be honest here: as I'm writing this post Sonic X Shadow Generations just finished downloading so I'm gonna just drop everything and go play that now. See you on the other side.)

...Okay yeah that game rules. Now to, uh, try and recollect my thoughts and get back to what I was doing over here.

Sonic Frontiers was *bold{{< sup "down" 3 >}}*. One of the wildest swings any Sonic game has taken in a long time, for all its issues, I have to say, I think they succeeded at revitalizing Sonic with this one. The combat system is wild and ambitious, the open world is a huge departure from everything that came before, and the music is going to live in my head forever now.

In a lot of ways, this game feels a little too ambitious, though. It definitely feels like once again Sonic Team wasn't given nearly enough time and resources to make the game they wanted to make, but nonetheless they manage to make something truly special out of it.

After having played the tiniest bit of Shadow Generations, it's pretty clear to me that Frontiers wasn't a fluke. It really feels like they've turned a corner, and I can't wait to see what comes next for Sonic.

And that's all the games for this post! Initially my goal was to go through all the games roughly in release order, but I won't hold myself to that if I find myself wanting to branch out into different directions. For now, here's the current standing of my tier list:

Thanks for reading! No idea when I'll get the next post up but I want to try and get these posts out fairly regularly.

Okay, that's all the time I've got. I gotta to get back to playing Sonic X Shadow Generations on my Nintendo 3DS.
