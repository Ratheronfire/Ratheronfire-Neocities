Here we are again! Hardly feels like any time has passed, and yet it's now just about a year (almost to the day) since [my last OSRS Leagues post](../osrs-leagues-4). I had a ton of fun last time, and this year I want to try and push even further than I did in my first attempt. I'd also like to try and make daily-ish progress logs as I go.

So, here's where I'm standing so far after the first day:

...I got a bit carried away I think

So, originally my plan was to, well, not have a plan, and just go in whatever order felt right to me. It took very little time for me to ultimately cave and start following one of the numerous day 1 checklists, namely [this one](https://pastebin.com/P51TSedi) from a Twitch streamer named Faux. No idea who that is, but their guide was pretty helpful, so thanks I guess! At this point I've finished most of what was in version 2.1 of their guide and from here on out I think I'm going to try and progress on my own.

As for the choices I made and my general direction, I've been thinking about focusing on ranged for the 100% accuracy boost it gets at the end of the mastery tree. I haven't actually done all that much ranged though, so maybe tomorrow I can focus more on building that up. I also selected **Kourend** as my first area unlock, though I'm not particularly tied to any area unlock at the moment. I've never done much of any bosses and absolutely zero raids, so maybe this would be a good time to start learning that? I want to try out Varlamore too, but Sol Heredit...

He scares me.

I can probably deal with Echo Hespori though. Another thing to look into for tomorrow. That does mean having to start up farming, which I haven't really touched at all yet. I'm very tempted to grab Overgrown and just ignore the skill entirely until then so I don't need to worry about farming runs.

On that note:

### *The Relics*

They did *not* make any of these choices easy.

Okay, the first tier was a pretty easy lock for me. I don't really care too much about woodcutting or fishing, and the ancillary skills that get boosts from those relics are easy enough to deal with, but **Power Miner** immediately stood out to me as the obvious choice. It smooths over some of the more painful aspects of mining, and it makes smithing completely irrelevant, so naturally I had to go with it.

Beyond the first tier, things start getting dicey. Typically I tend to land on the side of prioritizing relics that are fun to mess with and that break the game in interesting ways, so for the second tier I opted for **Dodgy Deals**. I couldn't get enough of Trickster last year, and so while I mourn the loss of the other benefits it gave (especially the free agility XP for walking around) there was no way I was passing up the thieving relic this year. You couldn't pay me enough to train thieving the proper way if I have any way out of it.

Friendly Forager was pretty tempting, though. The free herbs from resource gathering seemed nice, although when I can just freely pickpocket infinite supplies of herb seeds (and especially if I opt for the Miscellania relic) it probably doesn't matter too much. Saving 90% of secondaries was the main draw for me, but ultimately I'm not sure how much potion making I'll really be doing. Corner Cutter was also a pretty easy elimination: it makes agility a bit quicker I guess, but none of the items it gives you seem all that valuable.

For tier 3 I went with **Clue Compass**. I figured that one would offer a much better spread of useful teleports, both for clue hunting and for general use. It also more or less invalidates the other two options by offering convenient access to both a bank and the fairy network, so I just don't see the appeal of either of the other two.

And lastly, for tier 4, I chose **Golden God**. I wasn't interested in Equilibrium and I didn't really need another tier 1 or 3, so for me the choice ultimately came down to Golden God or Friendly Forager. I think ultimately Golden God is going to be the fun "let's see how fundamentally broken this game is now" unlock, so in my heart I knew there was just no other option. And so now I'm sitting here at the end of day 1 with level 90 magic and 103 million gp in my bank. All in all, a pretty good day if you ask me.

Looking forward, there's a lot of really hard choices yet to be made. I'm currently leaning towards Varlamore and the Desert for my 2nd and 3rd area unlocks, the former to explore some of the new content I haven't seen yet (and exploit Golden God even more with the construction shop), and the Desert to get the Echo Kalphite Queen's weapon which seems like it'll pair with the ranged masteries pretty nicely. For the tiers, at the moment I'm thinking either Production Master or Slayer Master, Banker's Note, Pocket Kingdom or Overgrown, and Last Stand, but those choices could easily change depending on how things go.

One day in, and I'm nearly at iron rank with 8.5 million XP and a total level of 872.

Leagues is downright wild.

Lastly, just for the hell of it, here's some heatmaps{{< sup "down" 1 >}} of my journey so far and a screenshot of my bank at the end of day 1. (Unfortunately the heatmaps are missing the first ~2 hours of data because I realized too late that it was also showing my main game history.)

You can find the plugins I used [here for the heatmaps](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/show/world-heatmap) and [here for the bank screenshot](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/show/bank-screenshot).

The heatmap plugin I'm using saves the images in a .tif format that browsers can't render, and I couldn't figure out how to convert them into a more common image format at 3AM, so I'm just going to post them as-is. Sorry.
