{{< load-photoswipe >}}

It's that time again when I, the sole arbiter of correct opinions, present the final and absolute truth of the Sonic series.

Or maybe this is all wrong, I dunno.

This time I decided I'd like to mix in some of the non-game Sonic media as well, because after all what's another three or ten posts? Not like I'm going to be finishing this any time soon either way.

## Sonic Generations

Still a really solid game! It's lost a bit of its luster since 2011 when so many of the later entries have both figured out 2D physics better and also are generally better to play, but there's still some fun to be had with this one. The levels themselves are a lot of fun in both 2D and 3D, and the sheer volume of new remixes means this game has had a permanent place in my music shuffle ever since.

At the same time though, this game established a lot of nostalgia-baiting trends that *really* dragged Sonic down for a while, like the obsession with the Green Hill/Chemical Plant/Sky Sanctuary trifecta and treating Classic Sonic as a recurring character completely separate from modern Sonic (except when they're still the same person sometimes).

The bonus stages aren't very good and there are way too many of them. I do like the collectibles though (which seems to be a pretty unpopular opinion), they do a good job of highlighting alternate routes without making them too obvious. (That said, the remaster adds a bunch of Chao to every level though and those are just thrown around thoughtlessly.)

Still not a fan of the final boss, either. It felt like they wanted to make another Adventure style showstopper fight, but it's not interesting, the gameplay doesn't make sense, and your buddies refuse to shut up and let you play. Not a great note to end on. That said, it did open the door for Shadow Generations, and...

## Shadow Generations

...Folks, I think they've done it. This is pure, crystallized Sonic.

The levels give you so much room for momentum with just the right level of pushback to challenge you to find faster routes, the gameplay is smooth and responsive, it looks downright gorgeous, and of course we get a bunch of incredible new remixes. The hub level in particular was particularly inspired. It took the best parts of the Frontiers experience and seamlessly combined it with the White Space hub from Sonic Generations, while also serving as a tutorial for all the new movement options, *and* providing a bunch of interesting new gameplay challenges on top of all that! I do wish finding all the collectibles was a little bit less awkward, but everything else about it was top-notch.

I was a big fan of the boss fights this time around. They were all reminiscent of their original fights, but redesigned from the top down to be more intuitive and engaging, with exactly the right balance of difficulty and fairness. Especially impressive when you look at how little they had to work with with fights like Metal Overlord from Heroes.

I also want to give a ton of props to the writing. For this game as a followup to Sonic Generations, you'd think the story would be more or less an afterthought, since these games are way more about celebrating the older games rather than standing on their own, and yet they gave Shadow's character arc so much weight and showed sides of him we rarely get to see. I love how this game takes the whole "let's go on a fun trip through all our past adventures" bit from Sonic Gens and turns it on its head, with Shadow quite literally running from and struggling to escape his past. I saw a lot of speculation about the constant reuse of Radical Highway, and there was one interpretation I really enjoyed which was that Black Doom is specifically picking that setting to remind Shadow of his darkest days when he was little more than a puppet for both Gerald and Black Doom himself. They took the framework of a nostalgic throwback game and recontextualized it into a story about trauma and self determination and I love it.

The movie DLC was... fine, I guess? The level itself was good but it really could've used a bit more content for how much they sold it for. Maybe a new boss fight or something, but I don't really know what that could be. Keanu's line readings were pretty dull, which is especially odd considering he's actually really good in the movie, and it's not like he hasn't done voice acting for games before. Maybe they could only afford like a half hour or so in the booth.

## Sonic Adventure 2

Following my experience playing [Sonic Adventure](/thoughts/unorganized/sonic-ranking-1/#sonic-adventure) for the last post, I decided to try my hand at the RetroAchievements for the sequel. As of the time I'm writing this post, I've beaten the main game, and I'm currently, uh... just over a third of the way through the achievement set.

Turns out getting the A Ranks is every bit as obscene as I've always imagined it to be. I spent the better part of a day grinding away at it, and for my troubles I've only just managed to finish up City Escape. So, that's just thirty more stages to go! Plus the boss rushes. And the handful of other emblems. and all the Chao Garden stuff. And a number of other achievements.

So, that's not getting done any time soon. But masochistic achievements aside, this game is still fantastic. In retrospect, having played the two again with adult eyes, I greatly prefer Adventure 1, for a few reasons. The main reason for me is the controls: In SA2, virtually all of your controls are mapped to one of two buttons: one for jumping, and one for basically everything else. I get it's supposed to be streamlined and intuitive or whatever, but even after having beaten the game I'm constantly somersaulting when I want to spindash or bouncing when I want to light speed dash (and that's not getting into how unreliable the homing attack is). The camera is a pain as well, but it's about par for the course for this era.

The other big issue I have is with the three different kinds of gameplay on offer, each one being a slightly less fun version of one of the modes from SA1. The Sonic/Shadow speed levels are *mostly* fine, but having the spindash be a held input rather than something mashable means my habit of zooming through every level doesn't work anymore, and instead causes you to somersault and immediately lose all momentum. The treasure hunting stages are decent as well, but the exploration just isn't as fun, and having to find each item in a specific order is a needless time waster. By far the worst offender is the mech stages. These are just... so boring. You move slow, the controls are super unresponsive, and unlike the Gamma levels in SA1 it just doesn't feel as fun to rack up lock-on combos since there's no real benefit other than points.

It's funny going back now and seeing how the game presents its story. In my mind it was way bigger and more involved, and so every time a big plot point comes and goes in a thirty second cutscene I get whiplash. It really feels like a majority of this game's reputation is owed to things that came about after the fact from later games, and from the audience themselves building the story up into something bigger than it was originally. The stuff with Gerald's final testament is still super strong, and the way it's presented feels uniquely Sonic Adventure and uniquely 2000s in a way I can't really describe.

## Sonic 3 [b/w](http://hrwiki.org/wiki/b/w) Knuckles

And of course I've also been trying my hand at the Retroachievements set for Sonic 3 & Knuckles, but unlike Adventure 2 I did actually manage to finish this one.{{< sup "down" 1 >}} Having played all of the main 3 Genesis Sonics (I'm of the opinion that Sonic 3 + Sonic & Knuckles is and has always been a single complete game), I have to echo the common sentiment that 3 is absolutely the best, personal preference for 2 aside. The music is (mostly) top-notch, the level design and overall balance demonstrate the mastery that this team had built up since their first entry{{< sup "down" 2 >}}, and the graphics are some of the most beautiful and well-realized this era of gaming had to offer. It also does a great job of telling a story without words or lengthy cutscenes, something that Sonic CD also did, to slightly less success in my opinion.

Hydrocity is two words.

## Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (Film)

I said a lot more about this movie in my [2024 review post](/thoughts/unorganized/2024-review/#sonic-the-hedgehog-3), but in short, I really enjoyed it! General kids movie annoyances aside, it was a fun time, and a better exploration of these characters than I expected it to be. It feels like they've finally started to dial in the right balance of obligatory Hollywood stuff and genuine love for the source material, and I'm excited to see what's next.

## Sonic (Restaurant)

Now this is a bit of an odd departure for this franchise. Rather than a game or a movie or a comic or anything sensible like that, this entry is a restaurant I guess? Not sure why the series went in this direction, but sure I guess.

The food is nothing to write home about, just slightly below-average fast food fare. Their breakfast burritos are probably my favorite of the menu options I've tried, though I'll admit I also have a soft spot for their desserts and their pretzel sticks. Their fries are pretty unimpressive, which is one of the most unforgivable sins a fast food place can commit if you ask me.

There's not much else here for the hardcore Sonic fan, unfortunately. There's no memorable characters and hardly any music, unless you count the guy behind the counter yelling "I don't know why you keep asking us about that stupid hedgehog, we're just a fast food restaurant, please just make your order already".

It doesn't have any long boss fights, so I guess it beats out Sonic Superstars at least.

And that's that for this update! Surprisingly I haven't listed anything lower than C yet, but I suppose it's only a matter of time before I have to take a look at the Game Gear games.

{{< sup "up" 1 >}} If nothing else, it gave me something to do this past January when I spent a good 14 or so hours on the train to and from my first MAGFest.

{{< sup "up" 2 >}} Okay, *technically* it's not really the same team all the way from 1-3 (especially considering the split between the devs who stayed in Japan to work on CD and those that left to work on 2), but you get what I mean.
