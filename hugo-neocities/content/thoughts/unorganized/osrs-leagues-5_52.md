And just like that, it's all over.

60,000 points! ***I'M FINALLY FREE***

This event has been both some of the most fun I've had in OSRS, and also some of the most frustration between the long wait for random drops and just the sheer amount of time it took to finally hit Dragon rank. I'm not sure if I'd want to do this whole thing a second time, but I'm glad I finally managed to fully finish a Leagues account. Maybe next time would go a bit smoother now that I've gotten used to endgame content (albeit with some of the most overpowered boosts imaginable).

So, now that I'm finally done with Leagues V, I'm not really sure what to do next. I think I'll probably want to take a little break from RuneScape for now, and there's tons of other games and projects I've been itching to get back to. I've had a 2024 year-in-review post half-finished for nearly a month now that I've been trying to force myself to finish, there's this past year's [Advent of Code](/thoughts/devlogs/adventofcode) that I still need to finish, and like 3 or 4 game dev projects I really want to return to, and of course a bunch of games my friends bought me for Christmas that I've just been sitting on.

Then again, what if I tried doing the Fight Caves on my real account?

What if?

I might write up a big Leagues retrospective posts in a few days once the event actually ends, too. Originally I planned to make a timelapse of those position heatmaps I posted on day 1, but at some point that plugin updated and seemed to have lost all of my data, so I guess that idea is out unfortunately.
