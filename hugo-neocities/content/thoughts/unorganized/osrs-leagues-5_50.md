This is really the endgame now.

As of this post, I'm now 2,970 points away from Dragon rank, effectively the end of Leagues as far as I'm concerned. I really didn't think I'd get this far! I *finally* managed to get a Twisted Bow, and as expected it's made the rest of the game way easier. Since then, I've touched most if not all of the bossing content available to me, and so I've ended up getting way more points than I expected I'd be able to by this point.

Figuring out what to do for these last few days has been tough, and there's been more than a few moments where it felt like I was about to hit a wall. Luckily I've managed to find a ton of easy-ish tasks to check off, and I'm reasonably confident I'll be able to get this all done in time.

I have a lot of points I could possibly earn from Chambers of Xeric, and now that I've gotten a good feel for how it works I've been able to handle group runs pretty consistently, so that'll probably be where a lot of the remaining points come from. Of course, with it being the last week of Leagues, relying so heavily on RNG-dependent tasks is pretty scary, so I'm carving out a lot of space for slower, more reliable tasks as well.

Almost there!
