Not as exciting as day 1, but I made progress on some pretty important skills today.

First off, new unlocks! I got my 5th relic tier today and I decided to go for **Slayer Master**. Last time I went for the clue relic, which was fun for a time, but the realization set in very quickly that I did not want to do very many clues, beyond what was necessary to get a bunch of tasks knocked out quickly. I also wasn't super enthused about Production Master, because aside from smithing (which I already have covered thanks to tier 1) none of the affected skills are really *that* annoying to train (plus it's nice to have opportunities to slow down for a bit, so I don't really want to take that away).

I also unlocked the Desert as my second area. Since I've already taken a couple ranged masteries, the darts and blowpipes the desert offers seem like a natural pair with their higher attack rate. I spent a bit of time today working towards getting situated with ranged, as well as completing the next combat task: getting a single kill on Scurrius. I've done that in the main game so I know it's easily doable, but as it stands there's a lot I still need before it's really viable.

I don't have access to prayer potions, so I needed to get some herblore levels in. And of course that means having to train farming, and *that* meant having to pickpocket from master farmers a bunch to get a baseline of seeds to work with. As much as I love Dodgy Deals, I'm definitely starting to feel the strain of not having a bottomless supply of herbs to work with.

I got my first 99 today, though! Golden God is absolutely busted. Less than 48 hours in and I've got max magic, as well as a healthy 200m that means I can essentially buy whatever I want. My plan today was to use magic as a temporary means of getting past the early game combat walls, but I'm running into the same issue I did last year, which is that there is basically nothing in terms of armor available in the starting areas. The best I can do is Xerician robes from Kourend, so I might just have to settle for that.
