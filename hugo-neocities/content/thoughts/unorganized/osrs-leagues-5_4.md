Making pretty decent progress now! One more ranged mastery in the tank, and I'm also closing in on the next area and relic unlocks.

Now that I've gotten a kill on Scurrius, I've been able to make ranged much more of a priority. My current goal is to finish off the Fight Caves, which I think is doable with what I've got currently, though I'm considering getting my mining and smithing up a little so I can get a better tier of darts going.

I made a couple attempts at the Fight Caves that went mostly fine, aside from dumb mistakes that ended up costing me the run. I've got a fairly stable source of prayer potions now so I'm more willing to throw myself into combat now, but my damage output still isn't quite where I'd want it.

I also tried tackling Echo Hespori today, just to see how it'd go. That fight is a lot more than I bargained for but I think once I get one or two more masteries down, plus slightly better gear, I should be able to handle it. It's mostly a matter of learning all the patterns and not panicking, which I'm getting slightly better at as I go.

As for my gear, I upgraded to red dragonhide today, and I also spent a few hours grinding up to 90 crafting to get an amulet of fury. I'm still stuck with adamant darts unfortunately, because the next tier is at the hilariously lopsided 89 smithing. I guess I do have Power Miner to soften the blow, but I can't say I'm a big fan of this grind.

Maybe I can also try and tackle the Echo Kalphite Queen sometime? The drygore blowpipe sounds like it'll be a *huge* upgrade to the ranged setup I'm using now, although if Echo Hespori is any indication I've got my work cut out for me.
