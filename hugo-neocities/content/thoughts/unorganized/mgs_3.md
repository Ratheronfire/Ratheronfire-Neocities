> Hopefully the next one won't take so long to make, but then again, the next game I have to cover is MGSV, so, uh

\- Me, nearly 4 years ago

Well, uh. Guess it's been a little longer than I expected. If you haven't read my previous posts covering [Metal Gear Solid 3](/thoughts/jnd/mgs_1) and [Peace Walker](/thoughts/jnd/mgs_2), I'd recommend checking them out, but basically the idea of these posts is that I'm going to try my best to recap the plot of the Metal Gear series (almost) entirely from memory, having not played or experienced a whole lot of them for a few years. I'll occasionally look up the odd name here and there, but generally I try to rely exclusively on my memory for the broad strokes. *(Just as a note, I believe there were other games between Peace Walker and MGSV that are debatably canon. I haven't played all of those, so let's just say they're non-canon and move on I guess.)*

So, MGSV. Arguably the most ambitious Metal Gear project, and arguably the most contentious game story-wise. The story starts, as a matter of fact, in Ground Zeroes, which was sort of a prologue game to tide people over during the game proper's extremely long dev cycle. Set a year or two after the epilogue of Peace Walker, the crew at Mother Base is preparing for a nuclear inspection crew from America to arrive, when Snake receives intel that Chico and Paz are being held captive at a nearby installation.

The two are being held hostage by a group led by a man named Skullface (he's called Skullface because his face looks like a skull, you see). Shortly before Snake arrives, Skullface orders his men to scrub all evidence as to who they are and what their ultimate mission is-- Skullface works for an organization called XOF, the clandestine cleanup crew for Snake's FOX organization. After FOX successfully carries out their missions, XOF is typically sent in covertly to cover up FOX's traces, a role Skullface greatly resents.

As is tradition, Snake sneaks into the facility, rescues Chico and Paz plus a handful of other prisoners, and makes his retreat. Snake and his crew return to Mother Base, where they learn that the inspection was a smokescreen for a military invasion, and the base is moments away from total destruction. After barely escaping back to their helicopter, Snake's men realize that Paz has been operated on, and a bomb has been planted in her body. They attempt to remove it, waking Paz in the process, who informs them that there were, in fact, two bombs. With no time left to remove the second, Paz instead jumps from the helicopter, only for the bomb to detonate moments later, sending Snake's helicopter careening into another helicopter.

Snake just barely survives the incident, though he is rendered comatose, having suffered severe brain trauma and the loss of his right arm. He finally comes to nine years later, in a hospital in Cyprus. Shortly after, a team of mercenaries is sent in to eliminate him. One of the assassins chokes out the doctor watching over Snake, but is stopped just short of killing Snake when the neighboring patient, who goes by Ishmael, throws a bottle of acetone at her and ignites it. The two then try to make their way to safety, evading armed soldiers, a yong boy in a straitjacket with bizarre psychokinetic powers, a man who's just on fire all the time, and also a giant flying whale.

Metal Gear Solid is a serious, grounded story about political intrigue and the spectre nuclear annihilation. It also has giant flying whales sometimes, as a treat.

After escaping the hospital, Snake is found by Ocelot, who has begun developing a new Mother Base while Snake was out of commission. The two make their way to a former Soviet stronghold in Afghanistan, where Snake's first mission is to seek out and rescue Kazuhira Miller, who has been taken captive. With the main three back in action once more, Mother Base is able to resume operations, though most of the men who once served under Snake are now missing.
