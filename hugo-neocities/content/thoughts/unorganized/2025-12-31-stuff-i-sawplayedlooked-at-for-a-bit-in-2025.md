Wow, another one of these, huh? I think I said that I was going to do more 2024 review posts, but, uh, happy 2026 I guess!

# Movies

## Shin Godzilla

After seeing Minus One a couple years back I've been interested in checking out more Godzilla stuff because I had never really engaged with it before, and so when Shin Godzilla came back to theaters this year I made a point to check it out. Now, admittedly I'm not a big anime guy so I haven't seen any Evangelion, so I don't know how much of that series' ethos is reflected in this movie but I really like how much this movie treats Godzilla like an aside to the greater focus on beraucracy and capitalist interference in government.

I also really appreciate the bits of nuance in the criticism of government here, where it's clear that those in charge *want* to solve this crisis, but they're incapable of getting out of their own way until it's almost too late. Really enjoy the scene where {{< spoiler >}}the prime minister sends the stand-down order down the chain of command to save one civillian (or to prevent a PR disaster?){{</spoiler>}}.

## The Naked Gun: The New One

As someone who only recently discovered the Naked Gun films and enjoyed them more or less (barring a lot of the edgier jokes, particularly the third one which falls so flat towards the end with a painfully long transphobic bit), I went in to this one with pretty low expectations. To my surprise, though, I really liked it! I'm not sure how much of that is just due to lack of competition due to this style of comedy falling out of fashion, but I imagine this movie will age a bit better than its predecessors in some ways.

You know, for some reason I'd convinced myself prior to this coming out that they had cast Adam Driver as the main guy instead of Liam Neeson and I really want to see that version.

## The Sixth Sequel to Jurassic Park

They sure do love making these things, huh?

I didn't mind this movie too much, honestly. Generally I'm of the opinion that there's only one really worthwhile Jurassic Park film, but some of the others I can appreciate in a mindless popcorn fodder sense. This one gets the job done well enough, though admittedly I haven't really thought about it at all since watching it, with the exception of one particular scene that felt like a proper homage to the "welcome to Jurassic Park" moment without being so directly reverent to it.

I think this movie is considerably more sensible than the previous Jurassic Worlds, which unfortunately also makes it a good bit less interesting, especially compared to the second where {{< spoiler >}}we go from watching the one remaining dinosaur on the original island crying in pain as an active volcano reclaims the land to a straight-up Hitman level where Agent 47 is a velociraptor{{< /spoiler >}}.

## One Battle After Another

I didn't see a ton of new movies this year, but I'm glad I saw this one at least because it was such a delight. The trailers admittedly gave me low expectations with Leonardo DiCaprio's whole "I'm jaded and don't really get pronouns" bit but it ended up playing a bit better in context. His character is *just* unlikeable enough to be likeable, like when he starts vaping in the middle of a parent-teacher meeting then starts ranting about the founding fathers being slave-owning monsters. Also a huge fan of the car chase sequence towards the end, which was shot in a suspenseful manner that I don't think I've ever seen before.

## Terminator

In my weekly movie nights I've seen a whole lot of movies that for whatever reason I missed out on, including the Terminators right around the beginning of the year. Having seen all of them, I can finally make the bravest statement of all time: Those first two movies? Pretty good time!

I have a lot of trouble picking a favorite out of the two though. I love the first one's grittiness and grim inevitablilty, but the second is no less intense in spite of being in some ways a lot more campy and hopeful. After that, though? I dunno, this series gets real silly. Terminator 3 is both a lot dumber and a lot less refined, but it has a few moments that hit just right, and I **love** how much of a knife in the back the ending is.

I'm not gonna say the newest one is a masterpiece of cinema or anything, but I love the concept of {{< spoiler >}}a Terminator from a doomed timeline fulfilling its mission and then being left stranded out of time, trying to figure out what continuing to exist means and inadvertently developing a conscience{{< /spoiler >}}.

## Men in Black

Now, this is a series I really didn't expect to enjoy at all. Men in Black, in my mind, was always one of those series that was big at a very specific moment in time that immedately stopped being relevant once its time in the spotlight ended, and while I don't think it's aged perfectly it's still a good time. The second one is pretty dull admittedly; outside of a few really nice moments between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, it's mostly just the greatest hits of MIB 1 done less effectively, with a poorly plotted mystery device throughout and a much less engaging villain.

...I actually really liked the third one, though. The {{< spoiler >}}time travel element{{< /spoiler >}} was a nice addition to this world, and it made for some really fun moments like the room-sized neuralyzer operated by a whole team. There was also International, which, uh, exists? It's inoffensive I guess, but it feels so unnecessary.

    class="center"
    alt="Screenshot from Men in Black 3 of Will Smith's character being loaded into a room-sized neuralyzer.">}}

## Home Alone

Yeah, somehow I've never seen these. I'm not sure why, they're a really fun time and maybe the perfect example of how a properly good Christmas movie works. The script for the first movie is airtight in a way I've rarely seen, and the second does an admirable job of keeping up the same level of carefully structured plotting. The third one, on the other hand, is maybe the most made-for-TV movie there's ever been, which is real weird considering it went to theaters. Also, for some reason instead of being bumbling comedic thieves the antagonists were hyper-competent international spies delivering top-secret military tech for North Korea? Also there's a wisecracking parrot.

I changed my mind, movies are awful.

# Shows

## Andor

Andor. ***Andor!***

I can't get over just how good this show was, beginning to end. Considering the nightmarish political landscape this show aired in, seeing such an uncompromising middle finger towards fascism and the coporate systems that go hand-in-hand with it was genuinely refreshing. Of course, it was also equally distressing to realize just how much of the world of that show rings true in this specific moment in time, and the uncomfortable truths of what needs to be done in response.

I don't know if there'll ever be another show quite like this but I know I'll never forget it.

## Strange New Worlds

Strange New Worlds, on the other hand, played things extremely safe this year, in a way that really disappointed me. There's been a lot of strongly argued criticism towards this season, from people like Jessie Gender that are typically very positive on modern Trek, and while I don't agree with all of the arguments I can certainly understand the frustration with this show's direction this year.

Four-and-a-half Vulcans in particular drew a substantial amount of criticism for the things that it (maybe unintentionally) had to say about race. I don't feel particularly qualified to weigh in on that argument and there are much more thoughtful reviewers than myself that have said their peace on the episode's message, so I'll just say that I think this is a case of well-intentioned writers trying to create a light-hearted story but failing to grasp the greater implications of what they wrote, or the ways it could be interpreted to imply some pretty heinous beliefs. That aside though, I was pretty disappointed overall with how toothless this season felt, even as {{< spoiler >}}they finally started taking baby steps towards acknowledging that the Gorn are not categorically evil monsters the Federation can kill with impunity (which, ironically, is exactly what they end up doing{{< /spoiler >}}).

## Doctor Who

This most recent Doctor Who season was very mixed for me. A good amount of it (granted there were barely any episodes this year in general) was really solid, well-considered, and intriguing in the way I expect from Doctor Who, but especially towards the end of the season it started to fall apart pretty fast. After The Story & the Engine, which was delightful and an absolute highlight of this era for me, we get an episode satirizing Eurovision which, like I said with SNW above, ends up saying some pretty nasty things in how it depicts its conflict. The episode ulimately concludes that violent protest against genocidal government actions backed by capiltalist interest is just as bad as the injustices being protested, and that peaceful demonstration is the way to go. Taking that message in the context of the real-world genocide being committed by the Israeli government, and the rightful criticism Eurovision has recieved for refusing to condemn Israel or exclude them from future events, left an extremely bad taste in my mouth.

I was also very disappointed in the two-part finale, which starts on an interesting setup of {{< spoiler >}}an alternate reality dreamed up by a self-obsessed far-right dweeb, where those with disabilities are rendered virtually invisible, and otherwise progressive people are forced to conform to an oppresively heteronormative society{{</ spoiler >}}. Unfortunately, the finale {{< spoiler >}}does virtually nothing with the returning legacy villain they teased in part 1 (something the previous season was guilty of as well){{< /spoiler >}}, and, worse yet {{< spoiler >}}turns Belinda, this season's companion, from an self-sufficient nurse into a struggling single mother through sci-fi magic{{< /spoiler >}}. I love so much of the first half of this arc, but the second really soured the experience for me.

    alt="Futurisctic video panel showing a performance by Dugga Doo, who's a sort of knockoff Jim Henson chicken-looking alien.">}}

## PLUR1BUS

Thankfully, this year was rounded out beautifully with something I've been highly anticipating for a while now, the next original series by Vince Gilligan and co.

Normally, I can be a bit hesitant to start a brand new production from a team whose previous work was as much of a complete package as this team's work, but since episode one of Better Call Saul I've had complete faith in this team to turn any idea they could come up with into gold.

Unfortunately it's a bit hard to talk about Pluribus without spoiling the basic premise, which I think is something that ought to be seen firsthand. For those who haven't seen it yet, all I'll say is that this show tackles an extremely high-concept science fiction premise, which gives them plenty of opportunity to interrogate their characters and their relation to eachother and the world they live in, as well as what it means to be a person in general.

I'm just gonna mark the entire rest of this post as one big spoiler:

{{< spoiler >}}
I can't get over just how stressful this show is, what an insane premise. The idea of waking up to a world where every single person around you is reduced to a singular, lifeless machine that knows all there is to know about you, and puts on the biggest, brightest smile as it sharpens the knife...

It's a zombie apocalypse where the zombies just want to be your bestest friend.

Since I started watching this show I can't stop asking myself questions about how this world operates. Do the Others dream at night? Are they still having children? Do they have children performing brain surgery? What about that one island that's refused contact with the outside world? Are there any animals that can be connected to the hive mind? Does the connection work if they're deep underground?
{{</ spoiler >}}

The 2-ish year wait for more episodes is going to be excruciating.

# Games

## Donkey Kong Bananza

Okay, I'll be honest, I really didn't want to get a Switch 2 at launch. I was fully prepared to wait until the games I wanted were out, but I got worried with the general state of things, and decided to get one sooner rather than later, before prices got really nuts. In retropsect I could've waited, but oh well.

All that aside, I really liked this game! I think there's something to be said about the Breath of the Wild-ification of Nintendo games as of late, and there's definitely an element of that in this one, but I think Bananza has a strong enough focus on what it does well that the more open-world "run around and do stuff" design structure feels appropriate here.

I really like the presentation, too, from the music to the art design to every asset being either a banana or an animal, to the new character designs. I only cried a little bit at the ending song the first several times I heard it.

## Other Switch 2 Stuff

Mario Kart World sure is a Mario Kart! I had fun with it for the time I spent on it, which was very little since I've never been big on kart racers. The costumes are fun. You can play as a cow. That's all I need really.

I took the opportunity to dip my toes into a handful of other Switch games as well, though I didn't really stick with anything. Playing Tears of the Kingdom at a proper high resolution/framerate combo felt pretty nice, even if I could get the same experience though *other unspecified methods on unspecified devices*

At some point dealing with the different configurations and splintered forks on shady hosting platforms and general buginess got to me I guess, and having a device that's a known quantity that I can expect to run Switch games as intended is pretty nice, even if I may miss being able to tailor my experience better.

I really need to get back to Metroid Prime 4. As of the time I'm writing this post I've barely made any headway in that game, and I really want to see how it shakes out for me considering all I've heard about the late game.

## Ratchet & Clank

This year I also decided to revisit Ratchet & Clank, a beloved series from my childhood that I drifted away from once it departed the PS2. I'd played the original trilogy and the PSP game before, but it'd been such a long time and I've been dying to give them another pass.

The first game aged a bit better than I expected, aside from the tail end of the game. This was before they nailed the combat, and so in some ways it takes a backseat to more standard 3D platforming. Still though, you can see the seeds of what's to come with the sequels, which thankfully leaned way more into the combat and away from the awkward steath gameplay that destroys the pacing of the last few areas of Ratchet 1.

I'm a little ways into the third game at the moment, and loving every second of it. Ratchet 2 was a experience even all these years later and the combat is just so, so satisfying. One of these days I need to go back and revisit the new game, I barely made any progress in that when it came to PC.

## RetroAchievements

I've been doing a lot of RetroAchievement hunting the past few years. In 2025 I mastered Ratchet 1 and 2 like I mentioned above, as well as, uh...

Sonic 3 & Knuckles, Donkey Kong '94, Blue Sphere, Zelda II, and, finally, Mega Man 1, which I'd been trying to get done since 2022. [Wily 3 buster-only](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/29635) was a trial, but so satisfying to get down.

# Everything Else

## The Protomen

ACT 3 IS REAL ACT 3 IS REAL

So I've been aware of The Protomen for a while, but it was only in the past 4 or 5 years that I sat down and actually engaged with their music. For the uninitiated, The Protomen are a band out of Nashville which since 2005 has put out a series of rock opera-esque albums retelling the story of Mega Man, or at least a very distant interpretation of it. In their world, Wily is the despotic ruler of a world unable and unwilling to challenge his rule, and where the few who dared to make a stand all have failed. Their third album has been in the works for an unbelievably long time after Act 2 was released in 2008, and now, just before the end of 2025, Act 3 is finally done. ...At least that's if you take their words at face value. Next week they're premiering Act 3 at MAGFest, and the speculation over what they're planning to play has been frenzied

 Over the course of about seven weeks, they released Act 3 piecemeal, culminating with the 15th track where {{< spoiler >}}after electing to make his final stand and bring Wily down once and for all, Thomas is apparently executed, the track closing out on the sound of his noose swinging in the wind{{< /spoiler >}}. Considering that they also released a single in 2022 that clearly takes place after the tracks released thus far, most people seem to agree that the story is far from over at this point, but until the album's official release sometime early January, we're just going to have to guess.

 That official release is also going to allow us to read the liner notes for Act 3 for the first time, which is where the true story of their albums lives. Admittedly I'm not the best at describing music or what I like about it in words, so I'll just say *you should probably check out The Protomen*.

## Royal Royale

Yeah, it happened again, I got overly invested in Minecraft RP. This one involved most of the same people as [Balloon SMP](/thoughts/unorganized/balloon-smp/), though over the course of a week or so as opposed to a month plus. The general structure saw players split into three teams in a vaguely medieval setting, where after a few days of prep they would begin all-out warfare in which only one kingdom would prevail. Naturally, the narrative took a number of turns along the way, resulting in {{< spoiler >}}the team I primarily watched, the Purple Kingdom, gradually became the villans (or specifically [Sophia Babiya, ~Queen~General of the Purple Kingdom](https://www.twitch.tv/sophiebaybey) became the villain, while the character that was initally presented as *the* evil character ulimately became the hero{{< /spoiler >}}. Unfortunately due to the streams being ~9 months ago, it's a bit hard to dig up clips, but I've got a few highlights here:

* [Fun times in the Purple Kingdom after they smuggled in an Elder Guardian to apply Mining Fatigue within their walls.](https://www.twitch.tv/sophiebaybey/clip/SpikyBlatantWerewolfDAESuppy-ZFdn-bm1y_FpByKs)
* [Introducing Rare Bird](https://www.twitch.tv/padabana/clip/DoubtfulBillowingHorseradishBudBlast-v4Cn3tbWtE5Drc09)
* [(it wasn't out)](https://www.twitch.tv/robbydude/clip/AlertJollyWaffleGrammarKing-Rv2FNfLSs-T4Ebgb)
* [8th-Dimensional Milk Drinking Techniques](https://www.twitch.tv/robbydude/clip/TacitBashfulMilkResidentSleeper-RSLkXLMlNOvySOH4)
    * [Milk, Part 2](https://www.twitch.tv/robbydude/clip/DirtyKitschyStinkbugAMPTropPunch-OhHPYaa1wea51oFa)

* [Rare Bird Pronouns (probably worth noting most of these streamers are gay in some fashion)](https://www.twitch.tv/skullvolver/clip/GoodResilientMuleBrokeBack-0VYxGzVIF_5dLq01)
* [Did you hear that?](https://www.twitch.tv/robbydude/clip/CarefulCleanTildePeteZarollTie-k-QuaPyPNlMZCqX4)
* [After Gilbert spent the better part of a day harassing Team Gold to get their items back](https://www.twitch.tv/padabana/clip/FilthyRealHerdBCWarrior-_gzsWZM2SmuKxyWq)


...Guess that was more than a few. There were so many more moments I couldn't find clips for, so if you're interested there are plenty of highlight reels around on YouTube.

Looking back, it's a little bittersweet thinking about Minecraft again. This event coincided almost to the day with the [BDS Movement](https://bdsmovement.net/news/boycott-microsofts-xbox) formally announcing their boycott of Microsoft, and by extension Minecraft, over the company's continued support of Israel's genocide. Of course being unable to play a video game pales in comparison to the actual real-world consequences of living in an age where these sorts of obscene crimes against humanity are being carried out so openly. I can only hope that within our lifetimes we'll see an end to this senseless brutality. Being able to watch streamers play a game I like would be nice too, but you know, priorities.
