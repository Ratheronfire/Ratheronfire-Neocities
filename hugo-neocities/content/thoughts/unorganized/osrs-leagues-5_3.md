Managed to level herblore just enough to get a handful of prayer potions, and with that I was able to defeat Scurrius, meaning I finally have my third ranged mastery! And with the Desert unlocked, I've started working on getting outfitted with darts.

Lots of options to play with now! Next I think I'm going to focus on finding some better ranged armor and training slayer a bit, and then I should be set to tackle Hespori as my first echo boss.

Ranged is already going so much better for me this year than magic did last time. I actually feel like I'm making progress.
