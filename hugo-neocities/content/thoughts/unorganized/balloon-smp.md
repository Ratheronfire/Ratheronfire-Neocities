Over the past month or so I've become obsessed with [Balloon SMP](https://balloonsmp.neocities.org/), an improvised story told through Minecraft RP streams on Twi-

{{< sub >}}wait hang on i'm being serious come back where are you going{{</ sub >}}

Okay, look, I get it. Telling someone to check out a Minecraft RP stream in 2024 is about the hardest sell there is. But believe me, this one is actually good (you can tell by the fact that most of the streamers were getting ~100-200 viewers on average).

***It's probably worth mentioning at this point that this post will be very spoiler-heavy, so if it sounds at all interesting I'd recommend watching some of the highlights before reading much further.***

The general idea is kind of a loose, free-form version of tabletop role playing, with a heavily modified hardcore(-ish) Minecraft server driving the narrative. There was also extensive work on modded content tailored specifically towards the stream and the developing storylines. The event ran for a little bit over a month, for somewhere around 9 hours per day. I was introduced to the streams through [Holly from RTVS](https://www.twitch.tv/hollow_tones/clip/InventiveProudCroissantTheThing-uMvDSgHarTAFCmXN), though I didn't really expect much going in. I had caught bits and pieces of other SMP events Holly was in, and so I assumed this was just another "we're gonna just play Minecraft and have fun with friends" kind of event at first.

[Then this happened](https://youtu.be/OJIVGpXkSWs?t=22211). A giant creature called a Globber being carried away by a red balloon, surrounded by a swarm of what I can only describe as murderous ASCII birds making the most eerie sounds imaginable, as the whole sky darkens slightly in their presence. At this point it was clear: Balloon SMP was something entirely different from the typical Minecraft stream.

That said, I didn't really start actively watching until around day 11-12. I ended up mostly sticking to watching people from Holly's team (Team E), mainly [Milk Ape](https://www.twitch.tv/milk__ape) and [SophieBaybey](https://www.twitch.tv/sophiebaybey). By this point I had missed... quite a bit of storytelling and reveals. In a nutshell:

* Creatures from around the world are being taken by red balloons to a volcanic-looking structure at the midpoint of all the players' bases called the Caldera.
  * The creatures are then dropped into a substance known as Hellium, which kills them and extracts their souls, coalescing them all into a formless mass of trapped souls.
* Team E has become increasingly convinced that the balloons and Hellium are too serious of a threat to ignore, and decide to investigate various means of destroying the Hellium, ideally freeing the souls trapped within.
  * They slowly realize that none of their strategies are effective, and ultimately decide that the only answer left is to try detonating a nuclear bomb at the Caldera. Due to the obviously destructive nature of this plan, they decide to perform a test run at a considerably smaller source of Hellium first.
  * One of the other proponents of the nuke plan, Gibson, was originally on Team C before they were exiled by the others for suggesting the use of nuclear weapons, and is now an informal member of Team E.
* A ghost named Poopghost{{< sup "down" 1 >}} begins working with Team E and reveals to them that her family has been consumed by the Hellium. After some disagreement she reluctantly agrees to bring them to a cave where they can gather the resources needed to create a nuke.
* Several players have managed to obtain invisibility cloaks, which they frequently use to spy on other teams (or sometimes on their own teams).

At this point I was hooked. It was clear that there was a *lot* going on with the unfolding story, which gave the players/actors plenty of opportunity to discuss the events unfolding around them and debate over what the proper course of action should be. The character work is so compelling and well done that sometimes I would forget that two of the more prominent characters were just Yoda and Gandalf (or highly distorted shitpost versions of those characters to be specific).

If you can write an emotionally satisfying story that gives gravity and emotional depth to a character named Poopghost you're doing something right.
