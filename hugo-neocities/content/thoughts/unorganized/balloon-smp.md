Over the past month or so I've become obsessed with [Balloon SMP](https://balloonsmp.neocities.org/), an improvised story told through Minecraft RP streams on Twi-

{{< sub >}}wait hang on i'm being serious come back where are you going{{</ sub >}}

Okay, look, I get it. Telling someone to check out a Minecraft RP stream in 2024 is about the hardest sell there is. But believe me, this one is actually good (you can tell by the fact that most of the streamers were getting ~100-200 viewers on average). The story these people tell throughout these streams is incredible. It's a mix of comedy, high-stakes action, and weirdly existential cosmic horror that I've never quite seen before.

***It's probably worth mentioning at this point that this post will be very spoiler-heavy, so if it sounds at all interesting I'd recommend watching some of the highlights before reading much further.***

The general idea is kind of a loose, free-form version of tabletop role playing, with a heavily modified hardcore(-ish) Minecraft server driving the narrative. There was also extensive work on modded content tailored specifically towards the stream and the developing storylines. The event ran for a little bit over a month, for somewhere around 9 hours per day. I was introduced to the streams through [Holly from RTVS](https://www.twitch.tv/hollow_tones/clip/InventiveProudCroissantTheThing-uMvDSgHarTAFCmXN), though I didn't really expect much going in. I had caught bits and pieces of other SMP events Holly was in, and so I assumed this was just another "we're gonna just play Minecraft and have fun with friends" kind of event at first.

[Then this happened](https://youtu.be/OJIVGpXkSWs?t=22211). A giant creature called a Globber being carried away by a red balloon, surrounded by a swarm of what I can only describe as murderous ASCII birds making the most eerie sounds imaginable, as the whole sky darkens slightly in their presence. At this point it was clear: Balloon SMP was something entirely different from the typical Minecraft stream.

That said, I didn't really start actively watching until around day 11-12. I ended up mostly sticking to watching people from Holly's team (Team E), mainly [Milk Ape](https://www.twitch.tv/milk__ape) and [SophieBaybey](https://www.twitch.tv/sophiebaybey). By this point I had missed... quite a bit of storytelling and reveals. Here's as brief of a summary as I can muster:

* Creatures from around the world are being taken by red balloons to a volcanic-looking structure at the midpoint of all the players' bases called the Caldera.
  * The creatures are then dropped into a substance known as Hellium, which kills them and extracts their souls, coalescing them all into a formless mass of trapped souls.
* Players who die remain dead, unless another player revives them using a Ritual Balloon, created using a Wither Star. If the soul of the dead player is nearby they will be revived, but both them and the person who summoned them will permanently lose a max heart.
* Team E has become increasingly convinced that the balloons and Hellium are too serious of a threat to ignore, and decide to investigate various means of destroying the Hellium, ideally freeing the souls trapped within.
  * They slowly realize that none of their strategies are effective, and ultimately decide that the only answer left is to try detonating a nuclear bomb at the Caldera. Due to the obviously destructive nature of this plan, they decide to perform a test run at a considerably smaller source of Hellium first.
  * One of the other proponents of the nuke plan, [Gibson](https://www.twitch.tv/padabana), was originally on Team C before they were exiled by the others for suggesting the use of nuclear weapons, and is now an informal member of Team E.
* Gandalf, one of the members of Team C, entered the Hellium for a short time, during which his max health decreased by several hearts. In the processed, he absorbed hundreds of souls from the Hellium, and for a time was able to communicate with the Blue Balloon, a cosmic godlike being which intends on feeding on the Hellium and the souls within. Its exact goals are unknown, though Gandalf believes it is both benevolent and necessary.
* A ghost named Poopghost{{< sup "down" 1 >}} begins working with Team E and reveals to them that her family has been consumed by the Hellium. After some disagreement she reluctantly agrees to bring them to a cave where they can gather the resources needed to create a nuke.
* Several players have managed to obtain invisibility cloaks, which they frequently use to spy on other teams (or sometimes on their own teams).

At this point I was hooked. It was clear that there was a *lot* going on with the unfolding story, which gave the players/actors plenty of opportunity to discuss the events unfolding around them and debate over what the proper course of action should be. The character work is so compelling and well done that sometimes I would forget that two of the more prominent characters were just Yoda and Gandalf (or highly distorted shitpost versions of those characters, to be specific).

The next couple days were particularly involved, with part of Team E departing to perform the test. [The results speak for themselves, frankly](https://www.twitch.tv/sophiebaybey/clip/ConfidentLuckyPistachioDxAbomb-ZKjmmjzkiJn5yy3e). Although the test was an apparent success, it only led to further fracturing within the various teams, nearly erupting into violence several times. In an attempt to lower tensions, Sophie gives her invisibility cloak to Gibson as a way of allowing them to meet with the others without fearing for their life, only for Gibson to run off, leaving the rest of the group with no idea what was to come next. Sophie, beginning to fear that nuking the Caldera would only succeed in destroying the trapped souls and further antagonizing the Balloons, agrees to destroy the two other nukes she was stockpiling, as a show of good faith towards the others.

That night, though, everyone was caught off guard by what Gibson was actually planning. Before Poopghost's soul faded (a lingering effect of her proximity to the first nuke), she gave Gibson an extra nuke. While the other teams were panicking and trying to figure out Gibson's plans, they managed to sneak their way to the Caldera and activate the nuke, just seconds too late for anyone to stop them.

I highly recommend [this highlight video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3Hi4RioIsM) from UnderseaDee showing the minutes leading up to the nuke. It's unbelievably nail-biting.

I don't want to say *too* much more about where the narrative goes from there, because there's just so many amazing moments that I couldn't possibly do justice. What I've described is only up to day 14 or so out of the full 33 days, so if you want to see more (especially the ending, which is best enjoyed completely unspoiled) I'd recommend looking into some of the streamers' VODs, as well as the various highlights that are being made.

Instead, I'd like to list off a few clips that have given me delight this path month or so.

* [Sophie getting impossibly good ancient debris spawns \(totally real, by the way\).](https://www.twitch.tv/sophiebaybey/clip/MagnificentFaithfulClamNononoCat-p_m-rfW_c2GfX2d0)

There were a million more clips I wanted to link, but Twitch doesn't really make it easy. Anyway, I've said a lot more than I intended to so I think I'm going to cut it off here and just say that this was one of the more unforgettable experiences I've had on Twitch Dot Television. The developers behind Balloon SMP did an incredible job, and they're currently running a [Ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/balloonsmp) to fund future projects they want to work on. I'd highly recommend checking out what they've done and supporting them if you can, they absolutely deserve it.

If you can write an emotionally satisfying story that gives gravity and emotional depth to a character named Poopghost you're doing something right.
