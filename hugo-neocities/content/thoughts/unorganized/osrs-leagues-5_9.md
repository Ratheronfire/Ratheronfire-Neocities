I've been busy the past few days.

It's been a little bit since my last post, and in that time I've...

* Completed the Fight Caves.
* Gotten a few kills on Echo Hespori and got the unique drop.
* Advanced to the final ranged mastery and the second melee.
* Gotten some kills on the Echo Kalphite Queen and got her unique drop.
* Gotten to the 6th and 7th Relic tiers.
* Selected my third and final area.
* And leveled up a ton of stuff.

Things are progressing a lot more smoothly than I expected. After getting over the initial hurdle I've been finding that the echo bosses aren't *that* bad, and once I learn their mechanics they're perfectly doable. Especially the Kalphite Queen echo, which to my amazement actually has mechanics now instead of just draining HP.

As for the relics, for tier 6 I picked **Banker's Note**. How could I not? Total Recall is nice and all, but Banker's Note is just so much fun to mess with. Plus it lets you roll into bosses with an entire ecosystem of sharks to heal with, so learning bosses is a lot less scary. For tier 7, I ended up opting for **Pocket Kingdom**. Going in, I was *sure* that I was going to get Overgrown, especially since I skipped over the herblore relic earlier. Honestly, though? Farming is pretty much a solved problem for me at this point. If I want to, I could easily just power-level to 99 at any moment by buying a bunch of potted plants from the Farming Guild. And Pocket Kingdom is a lot more worthwhile for getting easy herbs, anyway. Grimoire didn't really appeal to me much either, since picking Kourend meant that the only thing I'm really missing is the Lunar spellbook, which is mostly just minor quality of life stuff anyway.

I do have to say though, for as much as the slayer task does help in some ways, I'm really starting to wish I took Production Master instead. The processing times are starting to get to me.

For my final area, I ended up going to **Varlamore**. A big factor in that decision was the construction shop, which breaks the game's economy in all new and exciting ways. Thanks to that I've easily managed to max construction and prayer, as well as giving myself access to absolutely bottomless sources of wealth that will basically cover everything else I need. Of course, this also means that I'm going to have to tackle Sol Heredit, but after all I've seen I think that might actually be doable.

Maybe this weekend will finally be the time for me to look into raiding. I've never done anything remotely close to that but I've been wanting to try. I'd like to try them out with my friends, but I don't know how far along any of them are and I don't think they'll be catching up any time soon, so maybe I'll have to try them out solo for now.

That'll be interesting.
