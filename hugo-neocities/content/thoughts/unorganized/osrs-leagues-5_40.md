Oh right, I was posting these at one point, wasn't I?

So, I've done, uh... quite a bit since the last post.

I finally managed to beat not only the regular Colosseum, but also the echo version of Sol Heredit. I've also gotten a bunch of runs in at some raids, particularly Tombs of Amascut, which I've managed to get almost all the drops from. Unfortunately I've had no luck getting the Twisted Bow, which is pretty much the one final item I need to perfect my build.

I've also gotten 99 in every skill, and along the way I've managed to check off enough tasks to get up to Rune rank. Gotta say, feels pretty good! I don't know how much more momentum I have, but for what I've managed to do, I'm pretty happy. Looking at what I have left to do, it really feels like there's not a whole lot available to me that doesn't require excessive time investment, aside from combat stuff, which brings me right back to needing the Twisted Bow.

There's still a couple weeks left, so maybe I'll manage to get it soon? Or maybe I'll start playing other games again.

I miss other games.
