There's the tiniest bit of prequel syndrome here but I appreciate that they were much more focused on telling a story than answering questions that didn't need to be answered. Also liked that this one was a lot more character focused than Fury Road's non-stop tension, helps make this movie feel distinct and not just Fury Road 2.0.

My phone keeps trying to autocorrect the previous movie's title to Furry Road and I'm not sure what that means exactly  
probably nothing
