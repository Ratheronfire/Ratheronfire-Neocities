Enjoyed this more than the first time, but I've still got issues with it.

The first third-to-half? Solid stuff. Everything between Bilbo and Thorin is fantastic, and up there with some of my favorite Peter Jackson Middle-Earth stuff. But when we hit the big battle sequence, everything feels like it grinds to a halt. Not to mention all the weirdly disjointed extra bits, like the end of the necromancer plotline and the dwarf/elf love triangle plotline that I never cared much for.

Also, I could do without all the callbacks to LOTR stuff, like the namedrop at the end. This trilogy has enough to stand on without that.
