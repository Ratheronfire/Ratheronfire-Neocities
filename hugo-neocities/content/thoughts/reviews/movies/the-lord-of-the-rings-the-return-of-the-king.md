    So glad I finally got a chance to see these in theaters. Having watched all three, I can say with confidence these three as a single unit are my all-time favorite film, hands down.

    Watching this again in the wake of Bernard Hill's passing, his scenes hit way harder, and I was able to appreciate his character way more deeply than I ever have watching his performance, and the way he constantly straddles the line between projecting an aura of authority, and serving as a man of the people willing to ride out into certain death right alongside them.

    There's a million more things I want to say about this movie and the trilogy as a whole, but my brain is absolutely worn out now, so maybe some other time I'll come back and jot down some more unorganized thoughts here.

This movie achieves the unimaginable of earning 5 stars despite Legolas using the phrase "game over" after winning a drinking game.
