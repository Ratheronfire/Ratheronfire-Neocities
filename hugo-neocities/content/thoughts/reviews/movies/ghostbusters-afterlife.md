I think I would like this a little bit more if it was completely disconnected from the Ghostbusters franchise. Not much, but a little.

I keep going back and forth on whether this should be 2.5 or 3, because that last bit with the uncanny Harold Ramis ghost really drags it down. I didn't *hate* anything in this, but the reverence for all the Ghostbusters stuff felt super unearned.

EDIT: I was thinking a bit more about what I wanted this movie to be last night, i.e. a coming of age story about a brother and sister moving to a lonely town surrounded by strange supernatural happenings, and inheriting an estranged family member's mission to save the world from an ancient demonic power, and I realized...

That's Gravity Falls. I was just picturing Gravity Falls. The good version of Ghostbusters: Afterlife is Gravity Falls.
