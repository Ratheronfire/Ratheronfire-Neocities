This movie is... not good. But it's bad in some really fascinating ways that I can't help but enjoy.

The only thing I can say this movie actively improved on from the original was the soundtrack. In the first movie it barely felt present, but this one immediately felt way more alive, and it goes to some wild places by the end.
