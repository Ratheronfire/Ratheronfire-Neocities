The added story bits are starting to drag the movies down more and more, but the parts that work still work for me.

Maybe it's because these movies introduced me to the Peter Jackson movies and Tolkien in general, but I can't bring myself to hate these. Of course, I haven't seen the third one since the theater release so I'm not sure how that'll go.
