I tend to be a defender of modern Trek, but stuff like this *really* makes it hard on me. I had very little expectations going into this knowing how Discovery (a show I generally enjoyed, with a ton of caveats) handled Emperor Georgiou and Section 31, but even putting that all aside there just was nothing for me to enjoy in this movie. It's hollow, boring, annoying, and worst of all completely uninterested in any deeper critique of their decision to center this story on a fascist genocidal tyrant or the titular secret organization that claims to be the one thing holding the Federation together.

This is a bit of an aside but I feel like post-DS9 trek for the most part fails to understand that Section 31 was always intended to be an antagonist, and that their insistence that the Federation needs them is just propaganda. Modern Trek, in my opinion, isn't completely unaware of that, though - Picard Season 3 made it pretty explicit that Section 31 was complicit in war crimes and attempted genocide, and that the results of that were a net negative for all involved, not to mention planting the seeds of that season's overarching plot. Meanwhile, Strange New Worlds, for all that it does right, constantly makes highly questionable moves like presenting the Gorn as an animalistic Xenomorph-like race that the heroes can indiscriminately murder without guilt, despite them also having attained space travel somehow. I keep waiting for them to reveal that Pike's crew is just being misled by propaganda and that the real solution is actually sitting down and talking with the Gorn, but so far that hasn't happened, and we're currently sitting on a post-season cliffhanger with them attacking the Enterprise unprovoked, so...

I think I lost my train of thought there.

This movie is bad, and I wouldn't have been able to watch it without friends to riff on it with.

...Why was Jamie Lee Curtis in this?
