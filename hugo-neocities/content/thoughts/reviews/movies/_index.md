      has_spoilers: false
      short_review: "I think this is the only superhero movie I've seen in theaters, and I might as well retire now because nothing could ever top this."
    - title: "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"
      year: 2012
      rating: 4
      has_spoilers: false
      short_review: "The fact that this movie is as enjoyable as it is despite the numerous behind the scenes setbacks is a testament to how talented everyone working on it was. While the trilogy started accumulating more and more baggage as it went on, I still think the first movie is almost as strong as the LOTR trilogy with tons of memorable moments and great acting."

        How could I ever hate something so delightfully unhinged?  
        (Also the scene with the Goombas slow dancing in the elevator is truly high art.)
