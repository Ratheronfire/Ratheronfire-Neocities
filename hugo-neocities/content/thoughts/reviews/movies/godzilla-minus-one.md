My first time seeing anything Godzilla related, but I heard enough good things that I figured it was worth a look. I enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would, both for the action scenes and especially for the slower character work.

I appreciated that the story left absolutely no room for doubt on its stance on suicide missions. If it had ended with Koichi actually dying (which I wasn't expecting considering they explicitly called out the lack of ejector seats) the message would have fallen apart for me.
