I'm not a huge fan of Gimli being reduced to almost entirely comic relief, and the whole "Aragon is dead probably" fakeout feels like a bit of wasted time, but those are extremely minor complaints in a movie that does so much for me. It could've easily failed as the awkward middle chapter between the other movies, but this one more than manages to stand on its own, with an eerie, uncomfortable feeling that only gets deeper as it goes.

Favorite character: the orc marathon torch runner. Got the heart of a champion, that one.
