When Stupid Mario Brothers started making the rounds again I found myself a bit worried that I'd end up hating it and wondering why I ever enjoyed it, but honestly?

Forget all that, Stupid Mario Brothers still rules just as hard in 2025 as it did in 2009. Obviously it's a low-budget YouTube series filmed in some California suburb about video game characters dancing around and using lightsabers, so you kinda have to judge it on a bit of a curve. But even then I can't help but lose myself in this show all over again.

The first act of the movie is basically just a greatest hits of the early comedy-focused episodes. For the most part it's a good time, aside from them characterizing two of the only women characters as the most over-the-top angry girlfriend trope, in ways that felt reductive and outdated even in its era. That aside, act 1 feels like a fun variety show, erratically cutting from music videos to a game of Twister to whatever other ideas the crew could throw together.

Act 2 is where the capital-p Plot happens. The plot is... okay, how do I even evaluate the plot of the Stupid Mario Brothers movie? It's fine, I guess? Nothing super deeply planned out or anything, but everything is played with so much earnestness that every now and then you'll get a moment of genuinely really good acting, or costume design, or fight choreography. I think a big part of why this works for me moreso than most other shows of this era is that Stupid Mario Brothers is secretly way more King Arthur fanfiction than it is video game fanfiction. That's such a specific kind of nerdy that makes this show feel charming in a way where most others just feel pandering.

I don't know if I could ever explain to someone who wasn't there at the time why this series holds such a special place in my heart. Maybe you just had to be there.

Chwenty dollars.
