If not for the last couple minutes I would've said this was underwhelming and a *little* boring, but the ending reveal with David taking the ship was nice (a bit obvious I guess, but that's by no means a bad thing).

Not sure how I feel about the reveal that David bio-engineered all the stuff in the original Alien but think I like it?
