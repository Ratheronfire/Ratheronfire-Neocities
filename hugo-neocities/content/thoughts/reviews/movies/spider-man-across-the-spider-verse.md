    Things I love:
    - Basically every single visual in this movie, and how effectively it plays different styles off of each other to explore each character and their worlds.
    - The way it takes the common trope of "this story is about stories" and the concept of canon, and reframes it into a way of arguing against Miguel's conservative view of how the world/multiverse should be structured, and connects it to Miles' struggle to prove that he matters and that he has a place in a system that utterly disregards him.
    - The fact that the biggest threat the multiverse has ever faced is this unassuming loser who has a chip on his shoulder because some kid threw a bagel at him and nobody cares.

    Things I don't love:
    - The fact that this movie's themes are so closely tied to a movie that's now slated to come out four years after everyone has forgotten what happened in this one.
    - It's a bit longer than it should be (but I like everything that happens in this so I don't mind too much).
    - Could probably do without so many the winks and nods to other Spiderman stuff. Then again I'm a bit of an outlier in the way that I'm disengaged from a good 90% of superhero media so most of the references just fall flat for me.
    - The fact that the staff making this movie were forced to crunch for months of 80-hour work weeks to get this done and are probably dealing with it for the sequel.

I'll be honest, I'm not really a superhero guy. There's stuff I like, but I tend to only check in on superhero stuff occasionally. Some of the DCAU shows, the Arkham games, that sort of thing. But when it comes to Marvel stuff, my experience is basically only the odd Spiderman thing here and there: I saw the Raimi movies which were outstanding for the most part, the first Amazing Spiderman which was fine I guess, and a bit of that Insomniac game (really need to get back to that, now that it's finally on PC). But I hadn't seen a single movie or show from the MCU era, with the ecxeption of the first Spiderverse.

And I have to say, I was blown away by that movie. It was a beautiful visual showcase, it was funny, it was deeply moving, and it *felt* like a comic in a way no other superhero adaptation has managed. But when I learned there was going to be a sequel, I started worrying. I was afraid they would lose the factors that made the first Spiderverse so unique and meaningful, and that it would turn into just another endless Marvel content stream.

I've never been so happy to be so wrong about a movie. Across the Spiderverse is every bit as beautiful, funny, smart, and emotionally gut-wrenching as the first, and then some. If Into the Spiderverse set the standards for what a superhero movie can be, Across the Spiderverse not only met those standards but set an entirely new standard in the process.

Starting today I will be very impatiently awaiting the third movie. Cannot wait to see what this team has in store for us next.
