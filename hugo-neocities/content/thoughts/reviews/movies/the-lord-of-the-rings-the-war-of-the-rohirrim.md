A lot of the 3D CG stuff looked pretty rough, but the painted/animated stuff looked really nice. Maybe could've done without the more direct "don't forget we're trying to find that ring" stuff though it was nice hearing Christopher Lee again, I guess.

Turning the king into some kinda mythological legend/undying beast was a neat moment. Not sure how much of that is taken from Tolkien's stuff though.
