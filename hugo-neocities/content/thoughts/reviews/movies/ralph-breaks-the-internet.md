The brand stuff wasn't nearly as bad as I was led to believe, but I could've done without the meta Disney princess stuff being so closely tied to the plot.

Not quite as good as the first and a little bit on the nose, but the emotional core of Ralph and Vanellope still works for me.

EDIT: forgot to mention that I think I'm officially done with seeing Star Wars stormtroopers in pop culture at this point
