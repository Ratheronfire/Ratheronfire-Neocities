The fact that this movie is as enjoyable as it is despite the numerous behind the scenes setbacks is a testament to how talented everyone working on it was. While the trilogy started accumulating more and more baggage as it went on, I still think the first movie is almost as strong as the LOTR trilogy with tons of memorable moments and great acting.
