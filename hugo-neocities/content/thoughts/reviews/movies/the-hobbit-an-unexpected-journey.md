    Is this trilogy overly long? Yes.    
    Are the story additions mostly padding? Sure.  
    Is it as charming as the originals? Absolutely.    
    Is this review format tiresome? A bit, yeah.

The fact that this movie is as enjoyable as it is despite the numerous behind the scenes setbacks is a testament to how talented everyone working on it was. While the trilogy started accumulating more and more baggage as it went on, I still think the first movie is almost as strong as the LOTR trilogy with tons of memorable moments and great acting.
