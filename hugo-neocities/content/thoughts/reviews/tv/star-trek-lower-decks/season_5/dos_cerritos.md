*What better time to start reviewing Lower Decks than on the very last season?*

So, I'm not really as big of a fan of Lower Decks as a lot of people are, I guess. I like it a lot, but I've never really been over the moon about it. The whole "meta Star Trek show about Star Trek" thing feels like it kind of weakens the show a bit, especially with how they constantly make references to Star Trek things in ways that don't feel organic.

That said, this episode was a pretty solid re-introduction. I like the twist of doing a parallel universe episode, but the alternate crew is only a fraction of a percent different. I'm also glad that they're sticking to the cliffhanger of Tendi being pulled back into piracy from last season. This show tends to wrap up their season finale cliffhangers very quickly as a joke, which is funny the first couple times but I like that this time the consequences are a bit more lasting.

All of the alternate crewmembers being just different enough for everyone to downright despise their counterparts (except for Rutherford, naturally) is a pretty good bit, as well as giving most of the main cast some nice opportunities for bits and pieces of character development. Mariner's part of the story wasn't really anything we haven't seen before, though seeing her played against a version of herself that hasn't moved past her anger and instead ended up stuck in the captain's chair feels like a nice reflection on how far her character has progressed.

Tendi's plot in this episode was fine, but it didn't really wow me. I think due to this show's compressed runtime, the b-plots often feel undercooked, and this one was no exception with Tendi's crewmates abruptly revealing towards the end that they actually want to be more like Tendi, and give up piracy in favor of their actual life goals. I'm curious to see where this story goes with the Orion civil war though, it definitely feels like Tendi's crew is going to play a large part in it. (Incidentally, the reveal that the ship they were commandeering was a medical ship makes me wonder if they're trying to tie into the IDW comics a bit, since they featured an Orion doctor over there.)

Pretty decent start overall, but it leaves me wondering what shape the rest of this season will take. This is the final season, after all, so I think it's safe to assume they'll try and end with a bang, but nothing in this episode feels like it's really setting up all that much in terms of stakes. On the other hand, maybe it'd be nice to end on relatively low stakes, and just focus on giving all the characters a last hurrah.
