*What better time to start reviewing Lower Decks than on the very last season?*

So, I'm not really as big of a fan of Lower Decks as a lot of people are, I guess. I like it a lot, but I've never really been over the moon about it. The whole "meta Star Trek show about Star Trek" thing feels like it kind of weakens the show a bit, especially with how they constantly make references to Star Trek things in ways that don't feel organic.

That said, this episode was a pretty solid re-introduction. I like the twist of doing a parallel universe episode, but the alternate crew is only a fraction of a percent different. I'm also glad that they're sticking to the cliffhanger of Tendi being pulled back into piracy from last season. This show tends to wrap up their season finale cliffhangers very quickly as a joke, which is funny the first couple times but I like that this time the consequences are a bit more lasting.
