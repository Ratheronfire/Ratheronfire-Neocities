# Ratheronfire's Assorted Collection of Odd Projects

Haldo! Welcome to one of the less bad sites on the internet! This site serves as a hosting ground for some of the projects I've developed over the years, as well as some of the random posts, reviews, and general thoughts I've decided to catalog here.

I've taken to treating this site as an experiment in discovering how large and complex of a website I can make while still holding mostly true to the 90's low-tech browsing experience. While I use a static site generator to handle putting everything in place, I've made an effort to avoid using Javascript entirely, aside from some of the projects hosted here that inherently require it (stuff like Godot projects hosted in an HTML5 player).

I hope you enjoy the sights and sounds, and please be sure to keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times. The gift shop will be on your right at the end of the ride.
