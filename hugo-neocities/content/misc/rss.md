Because this site is home to a large assortment of projects, blog posts, and whatever other stuff I decide to post on a whim, I've set up a number of separate RSS feeds targeting specific portions of the available content.

* {{< rss_link "Update Announcements" "/updates.xml" >}} - This feed updates very infrequently, usually when I have major announcements to make.
* {{< rss_link "All New Posts" "/index.xml" >}} - Lists every new post, regardless of section or subject. I tend to add updates in batches fairly often, so be prepared for some spam if you subscribe to this one!
* [Posts By Category](/categories) - Feeds for specific categories of posts. The main feeds you might wish to follow are {{< rss_link "blog posts" "/categories/blog/index.xml" >}}, {{< rss_link "projects" "/categories/projects/index.xml" >}}, and {{< rss_link "reviews" "/categories/reviews/index.xml" >}}, but there are others that might catch your interest as well.
* [Posts By Tags](/tags) - Feeds for posts with specific tags. These mainly exist for organization, but if you want to subscribe to any of them for some reason you can.
