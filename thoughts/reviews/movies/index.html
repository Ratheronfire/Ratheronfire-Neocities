            <summary><i>Lots of words ahead!</i></summary>
            <p>I'll be honest, I'm not really a superhero guy. There's stuff I like, but I tend to only check in on
              superhero stuff occasionally. Some of the DCAU shows, the Arkham games, that sort of thing. But when it
              comes to Marvel stuff, my experience is basically only the odd Spiderman thing here and there: I saw the
              Raimi movies which were outstanding for the most part, the first Amazing Spiderman which was fine I guess,
              and a bit of that Insomniac game (really need to get back to that, now that it's finally on PC). But I
              hadn't seen a single movie or show from the MCU era, with the ecxeption of the first Spiderverse.</p>

            <p>And I have to say, I was blown away by that movie. It was a beautiful visual showcase, it was funny, it
              was deeply moving, and it *felt* like a comic in a way no other superhero adaptation has managed. But when
              I learned there was going to be a sequel, I started worrying. I was afraid they would lose the factors
              that made the first Spiderverse so unique and meaningful, and that it would turn into just another endless
              Marvel content stream.</p>

            <p>I've never been so happy to be so wrong about a movie. Across the Spiderverse is every bit as beautiful,
              funny, smart, and emotionally gut-wrenching as the first, and then some. If Into the Spiderverse set the
              standards for what a superhero movie can be, Across the Spiderverse not only met those standards but set
              an entirely new standard in the process.</p>

            <p>Starting today I will be very impatiently awaiting the third movie. Cannot wait to see what this team has
              in store for us next.</p>

            <summary><i>Spoilers ahead!</i></summary>

            <p><i>(Note: I wrote this up as a rough summary of my thoughts after watching the series for the first time
                leading up to the new movie. Copying them over here for posterity.)</i></p>

            <hr>

            <p>Like with Reloaded, I had absolutely no idea where Revolutions was going to lead me going in. I knew we
              were going to see Agent Smith in the real world, I knew we were going to see the sentinels attack Zion,
              and I knew there was going to be *something* happening with Smith in the Matrix. But I had no idea how
              exactly we were going to get there or what crazy new plot directions we'd see along the way. There are a
              lot of ideas in this movie that I find interesting, like the idea that programs can reproduce like humans,
              and that Neo seems to have some innate ability to perceive and communicate with machines outside of the
              Matrix. I'm also a big fan of the idea that the Matrix is at war with itself, as the Agent Smith program
              starts becoming too powerful to control, in response to Neo himself becoming too powerful to control.</p>

            <p>There were also a lot of things I wasn't super happy with: the Merovingian subplot again leads nowhere
              other than getting us to the next part of the story, and the Zion fight drags on just a fair bit (but the
              effects are so well done that I can't complain too much). I'm also conflicted about the real-world Agent
              Smith plot point: on the surface, it doesn't seem to amount to much, since all it accomplishes is
              rendering Neo blind so he's forced to operate on instinct alone. But the more I think about it, the more
              it makes sense that it exists in the story: not only does their fight foreshadow the Neo/Smith fight in
              the Matrix later, but it also further establishes that human brains and Matrix programs are more
              compatible than you might assume initially, like Reloaded hints at.</p>

            <p>Once again Hugo Weaving is an absolute delight in every scene. While I do think the focus on his
              character gets pretty excessive in this movie, all the random shots of the Smiths reacting to everything
              going on around them are just so much fun to watch. For the most part the rest of the acting is also quite
              good, especially Ian Bliss as the Smithed-up Bane, who does a surprisingly convincing impression of Hugo
              Weaving during the real-world fight. Mary Alice's take on the Oracle is also quite good, considering the
              unfortunate real-world circumstances that forced Gloria Foster's re-casting.</p>

            <p>There's not nearly as much to say here as the previous movie, because so much more of this movie is taken
              up by the fight in Zion, and then the fight in the Matrix. I think that sequence would have worked a lot
              more if a lot of the action was cut out, and maybe if they intercut with Neo and Trinity's subplot more
              often. Honestly, a lot of these two movies could be improved with a shorter cut, maybe one that turned the
              two into a single three-hour movie. I kind of got the sense that was the original intention, though I
              haven't looked up if that was the case or not. I bet there's a good fan edit that trims them down into a
              single movie, actually...</p>

            <p>The Matrix Reloaded is probably the weakest of the trilogy, but it still has a lot to offer and I'm glad
              that I watched it. The final fight between Neo and Smith is a ton of fun to watch even if it's
              over-the-top and completely nonsensical, but then again I think that's the point. While I do think there
              could have been a much more tightly made and traditional version of this story, a part of me thinks that
              this story could only be told in the convoluted, sometimes messy way that it was.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Look, I've been on the internet for a while now. I know the Matrix sequels have a... less than stellar
              reputation among fans. There are a lot of issues with these movies, and despite everything I've heard, I
              wanted to go in with an open mind. Having now seen both of the Matrix sequels, I have to say while I do
              agree with a lot of the criticisms, I feel like there's a lot more good in these movies than people give
              them credit for.</p>

            <p>I was happy to see the second movie pick up a lot of the threads from the first movie that I thought were
              really interesting: the colony of liberated humans in Zion, Agent Smith's sudden turn when he revealed
              that he, too, wants out of the Matrix, and the idea that there have been several previous attempts at the
              Matrix before what we've been watching are all really interesting and I think they're paid off pretty well
              in this movie.</p>

            <p>This movie also recontextualized a lot of the myth around The One from the first movie. Some would argue
              that they completely subverted the meaning of that movie, and you know what? They're totally right. But
              that's another thing I love about this movie. The reveal that The One is just another tool the Matrix uses
              to rein in its control over the human population was truly unexpected, and the way it makes all of our
              heroes' victories feel hollow and meaningless really hammers in just how complete the Matrix's control
              over the humans are. Even when they feel like they're about to grasp ultimate victory, they're playing
              right into the hands of the system they cannot control.</p>

            <p>After the success of the first movies, the Wachowskis made a pretty clearly noticeable effort to one-up
              the action of the last movie. Sometimes it works, like the highway sequence, which peaks with Morpheus
              taking out a katana and slicing a car up its side as it speeds past him, before blowing it up and killing
              the vampire ghosts driving it in a massive ball of fire. That for me is the Matrix at its best, when the
              movie drops its serious, grounded facade and gives us exactly what they know we desperately want. The
              Agent Smith fight, on the other hand, didn't work as well for me. They clearly bit off more than they
              could chew, and the increasingly questionable CG on the background Agent Smiths becomes more than a bit
              jarring after a while. When your CG makes Hugo Weaving look like dril's Jack Nicholson avatar, it might be
              time to scale things back a bit.</p>

            <p>This movie also brings us to Zion for the first time, where we see just how massive the human resistance
              cell living there is. In the first movie we only saw the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar, so it wasn't clear
              just how many people had been freed yet. So many, in fact, that they're able to pack a massive cave full
              for a rousing speech from Morpheus, immediately followed by a techno rave intercut with a really rough sex
              scene between Neo and Trinity, as if the Wachowskis are trying to warn the audience up front: "if you're
              not 100% up for whatever we feel like throwing at the screen, you'd better leave now because we're not
              letting up any time soon." Cave raves, vampire ghosts, orgasm cake. It's scientifically impossible to
              predict what's going to happen in the next scene at any point in this movie.</p>

            <p>I guess I should talk about that scene now. You know the one. The scene with the Architect is probably
              the most well-remembered scene from this movie, next to the Smith fight. Some people love it, others
              absolutely hated it. This is where most of the movie's plot and backstory is revealed to Neo and to us:
              the Matrix has been on this cycle for a long time now, and The One is just another piece in it. No matter
              what the Matrix did, it couldn't fully eliminate the variable of human choice, which naturally led to a
              small subset of humans learning they were in a simulation, breaking out, and banding together to free the
              rest of their people. To address this anomaly, the One was created, as well as the Agents to oppose him.
              The One would be prophecised to bring about the end of the Matrix by the Oracle (who was also a program
              within the Matrix), and the other humans would congregate around him. Eventually this would lead to the
              One finding his way to the Source, a mysterious point close to the core of the Matrix's programming,
              watched over by the Architect, who would present the One with two options: sacrifice himself so that his
              program could be used to suppress the rest of the humans' free will, or refuse, allowing the growing
              corruption caused by free will to bring the Matrix down, killing all the humans connected to it. Either
              way the Matrix's robot armies would overwhelm and destroy Zion, meaning only those in the Matrix had a
              chance at survival. To the Architect's surprise, Neo breaks from his expected behavior and does not choose
              to sacrifice himself, believing there might still be another way to save everyone.</p>

            <p>I think the main reasons I've seen people criticize this scene are 1: the Architect doesn't clearly
              explain the entire situation, and 2: it's a massive exposition dump at the end of an already dense movie.
              Personally, while I see the issues with it I can't help but love this scene. Seeing all of the alternate
              responses Neo could've had to each revelation on the TV screens surrounding him really shows how much
              every action he could take was expected and planned for, and leads me to wonder how many times this
              conversation has actually happened. (The Architect says six, but who knows if he's really telling the
              truth? Maybe he lost count himself.) Of course, throughout all of these alternate scenarios, Neo was
              always expected to sacrifice himself eventually, because his love for humanity was too strong for him to
              take any other option. When he chooses the other door though, he says that he's doing it not for his love
              of humanity, but his love of Trinity. (Frankly I never really bought the romantic arc between the two, but
              there you have it.)</p>

            <p>I also really like how the Architect is practically grinning over what he thinks is yet another total
              victory over the humans. He believes that once again he's managed to put the humans back in their place,
              and that once Neo is demoralized by his revelations he'll make the same choice he always has. I do kind of
              wish we got a bit more in the way of specifics here: Why exactly does Neo choosing not to sacrifice
              himself mean that the Matrix will collapse? And how does him sacrificing himself stop it? If we want to go
              way overboard in the computer metaphor, maybe the liberated humans are causing fragmentations in the
              Matrix's storage, and allowing too many of them to leave means the Matrix hard drives need to be
              defragged. Something like that, I guess?</p>

            <p>Of course, this movie also ends rather infamously on a "to be concluded" cliffhanger, when Neo and one of
              the other survivors whose brain has been overwritten by Agent Smith exit the Matrix. I was pretty taken
              back by that, because I had no idea going in that the movies were so directly tied together, or that the
              next movie was only 5 months later. The "Agent Smith in the real world" cliffhanger is decent, but it
              feels kind of underwhelming after all the intense worldbuilding leading up to it. The fact that a rogue
              program can overwrite a flesh and blood brain is pretty interesting though, and it makes sense: if your
              brain was developed by birth to interface with a massive interconnected web of machines, it's not so
              far-fetched to imagine that your brain would develop to be compatible with their software, or that it
              could even be partially mechanical (the humans all grow with Matrix connective nodes throughout their
              bodies, after all). That could also explain how Neo is able to control the Sentinels in the real world.
              After watching Reloaded I developed a theory that as Neo is the One within the Matrix, the robots in the
              real world would react to his presence, either instinctually, or to help further sell the illusion that he
              has powers beyond normal human capability. Of course, if a brain could be overwritten by Agent Smith,
              maybe Neo's brain being able to interact with other machines in the real world is plausible too: after
              all, a human's brain isn't so far from a machine at a conceptual level.</p>

            <p>To sum up my feelings on The Matrix: Reloaded, I'll just say that while it's definitely less cohesive
              than the first one, I think it has a lot of really well imagined worldbuilding going on, and it builds on
              the established lore in some genuinely novel ways. It also has a lot more scenes that don't really feel
              like they contribute much like most of the Merovingian subplot, and a lot of "the characters go here then
              they go here then they do this", like the Merovingian subplot. Following this movie I was, if not excited,
              at least very curious to see how this trilogy ended, as well as seeing where the franchise could go
              following it.</p>

            <p><i>(Note: I wrote this up as a rough summary of my thoughts after watching the series for the first time
                leading up to the new movie. Copying them over here for posterity.)</i></p>

            <hr>

            <p>Even if you've never seen The Matrix, you've seen The Matrix. Very few movies are as iconic and embedded
              into our culture as this one, and even little things like Switch's "not like this" scene still show up all
              the time in casual conversation. So, naturally, it was hard for me to shut out the "hey, I recognize that
              bit" part of my brain constantly screaming every time something that has been memed to the moon and back
              happened. It's kinda like trying to watch Seinfeld or Monty Python in 2021: every single line has been
              repeated a million times since their release, so you can't help but focus on them.</p>

            <p>That aside, I really enjoyed the first Matrix, and I can absolutely see why it's had such an enduring
              legacy. The worldbuilding is (nearly) perfectly executed, and Neo's struggle to understand and rationalize
              what he's seeing as he's forced to confront the fact that his reality isn't what he believed is something
              I think everyone can relate to on some level. I also really enjoyed the action scenes, even if by today's
              standards they look a bit cartoony. The Matrix is just so confident in itself and its audience that it
              knows it can throw more and more outlandish things at you, since once it has its hooks in you it knows
              you'll fully believe it when Neo begins completely altering the virtual world and doing what should be
              impossible.</p>

            <p>I'm also a big fan of the acting in this movie, even if it's often over the top and goofy (and often
              times because of that). I think my favorite performances were probably Lawrence Fishburne with his firm
              belief in the prophecy of the One and his determination to do whatever he can to fight for his peoples'
              freedom, and of course Hugo Weaving's... well, everything, really. But then again I'm also a huge Lord of
              the Rings mark, so more Hugo Weaving is always welcome for me. I also really enjoyed Keanu Reeves'
              reserved acting as he tries to distance himself from the world around him that seems too horrifying to
              accept at first, as well as Gloria Foster as the warm but somehow still unnerving Oracle.</p>

            <p>I've found this to be a pretty popular opinion, but I wasn't a big fan of the "the humans in the Matrix
              are just batteries" plot point. I think it'd just make more sense for them to be nodes in a hivemind kind
              of like the Borg, especially considering there are much more convenient power sources than an entire human
              being that needs regular exercise and nourishment. The explanation that the humans blocked out the Sun
              also seemed a bit silly to me -- surely this planetwide army of robots isn't just solar powered, right?
              You can really tell the executives were afraid audiences wouldn't understand the Matrix unless everything
              was spelled out in as simple terms as possible, and simple just isn't how the Wachowskis work.</p>

            <p>Speaking of the Wachowskis, MAN is this movie a trans allegory. I had heard it was going in, but I
              figured that was just people reading too deeply into what was shown. Now that I've seen how the movie
              plays out, it's pretty obvious what was on their minds at the time -- the red vs. blue pill scene, Trinity
              talking about how everyone on the internet assumes she's a male, and the main villain literally deadnaming
              the protagonist. I'm by no means an expert on trans culture (I'm a cisgendered white man so go figure) so
              maybe my perspective is incomplete but I really got the sense that was what they were going for.</p>

            <p>One last note on the first movie: I was a bit uncertain on the whole concept of "The One" at first. I
              typically don't really care for chosen one/prophecy plot elements, especially in a movie that goes so far
              to justify all of its worldbuilding. That being said, the movie does a good job of making that element
              work, especially with Morpheus's unwavering belief in everything the Oracle says will happen. Later on in
              the trilogy this idea is expanded on a lot more, in ways that I think are much more interesting
              personally.</p>

            <p>Overall, the first Matrix is every bit as good as I was always told it was. Even though it took me 20
              years to finally come around to watching it, it still works just as well as it did in 1999.</p>

            <p>Watched the 40th anniversary theater re-issue with a couple of friends. Still a fantastic movie and one
              of my all-time favorites, though every time I see it the dumber aspects are more apparent to me.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>An entire planet blowing up offscreen and shifting the orbit of another planet</li>
              <li>The Genesis device being able to create life on a planetary scale from nothing</li>
              <li>The Genesis device detonating in the middle of a nebula creating a new planet orbiting a star (???)
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Of course the rest of the movie is more than strong enough to make up for the bits of questionable
              science - after all, this movie is way more about Kirk's struggle with aging and Khan's self-destructive
              obsession with revenge, both of which work so well from both the writing and acting sides.</p>

            <p>Pretty sure the version we saw was the director's cut, which included a few scenes that immediately stuck
              out to me, having seen the original so often. None of them *really* felt necessary, but there were some
              nice moments to help round out the movie a bit, like giving Scotty's nephew a whole two lines before being
              torpedoed (as opposed to the one in the original, where his relation to Scotty is never revealed).</p>

            <p>...Speaking of, what exactly was up with Scotty bringing his horribly burned nephew up to the bridge
              before going to sickbay? Maybe he'd survive if they just went there in the first place.</p>

            <p>Lastly, I'd be a fool to write all this without talking about Spock's death. This movie has what I think
              is Nimoy's best performance as Spock, and his death scene is a big reason why. Never quite got the logic
              of why he decided that he had to be the one to repair the warp drive (or what exactly he was doing to fix
              it) but it works fine for me.</p>

            <p>Overall this movie continues to be one of my favorite Star Trek experiences, and proof that big-budget
              effects showpieces aren't always necessary to tell a meaningful story (see also: Duet, my favorite Star
              Trek episode).</p>

            The fact that this movie is as enjoyable as it is despite the numerous behind the scenes setbacks is a
            testament to how talented everyone working on it was. While the trilogy started accumulating more and more
            baggage as it went on, I still think the first movie is almost as strong as the LOTR trilogy with tons of
            memorable moments and great acting.
