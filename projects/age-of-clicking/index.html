					<br />
					<p>
						The first iteration of Age of Clicking, written using Angular and TypeScript.
						This started out as a learning exercise in Angular, but it quickly grew out of proportion and I ultimately
						couldn't figure out how to maintain stable framerates for the kind of game I wanted this to be.
						I ended up halting development on this version and moving to Unity instead after just
						under a year or so on this project.

					<h2><a href="https://ratheronfire.itch.io/age-of-clicking">Age of Clicking - Unity Version</a></h2>
					<br />
					<p>
						The second iteration of Age of Clicking, written in Unity.
						The Unity version got a lot further along, though I never really had a clear idea of what I wanted the game to be or how to make it.
						Not officially cancelled yet (I still think about returning to it from time to time), but I haven't touched this in quite a while now.
